* NAME
       ffmpeg - ffmpeg video converter

* SYNOPSIS
       ffmpeg [global options] [[infile options][-i infile]]... {[outfile
       options] outfile}...

* DESCRIPTION
       ffmpeg is a very fast video and audio converter that can also grab from
       a live audio/video source. It can also convert between arbitrary sample
       rates and resize video on the fly with a high quality polyphase filter.

       ffmpeg reads from an arbitrary number of input "files" (which can be
       regular files, pipes, network streams, grabbing devices, etc.),
       specified by the "-i" option, and writes to an arbitrary number of
       output "files", which are specified by a plain output filename.
       Anything found on the command line which cannot be interpreted as an
       option is considered to be an output filename.

       Each input or output file can in principle contain any number of
       streams of different types (video/audio/subtitle/attachment/data).
       Allowed number and/or types of streams can be limited by the container
       format. Selecting, which streams from which inputs go into output, is
       done either automatically or with the "-map" option (see the Stream
       selection chapter).

       To refer to input files in options, you must use their indices
       (0-based). E.g.  the first input file is 0, the second is 1 etc.
       Similarly, streams within a file are referred to by their indices. E.g.
       "2:3" refers to the fourth stream in the third input file. See also the
       Stream specifiers chapter.

       As a general rule, options are applied to the next specified file.
       Therefore, order is important, and you can have the same option on the
       command line multiple times. Each occurrence is then applied to the
       next input or output file.  Exceptions from this rule are the global
       options (e.g. verbosity level), which should be specified first.

       Do not mix input and output files -- first specify all input files,
       then all output files. Also do not mix options which belong to
       different files. All options apply ONLY to the next input or output
       file and are reset between files.

       o   To set the video bitrate of the output file to 64kbit/s:

                   ffmpeg -i input.avi -b:v 64k -bufsize 64k output.avi

       o   To force the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps:

                   ffmpeg -i input.avi -r 24 output.avi

       o   To force the frame rate of the input file (valid for raw formats
           only) to 1 fps and the frame rate of the output file to 24 fps:

                   ffmpeg -r 1 -i input.m2v -r 24 output.avi

       The format option may be needed for raw input files.

* DETAILED DESCRIPTION
       The transcoding process in ffmpeg for each output can be described by
       the following diagram:

                _______              ______________               _________              ______________            ________
               |       |            |              |             |         |            |              |          |        |
               | input |  demuxer   | encoded data |   decoder   | decoded |  encoder   | encoded data |  muxer   | output |
               | file  | ---------> | packets      |  ---------> | frames  | ---------> | packets      | -------> | file   |
               |_______|            |______________|             |_________|            |______________|          |________|

       ffmpeg calls the libavformat library (containing demuxers) to read
       input files and get packets containing encoded data from them. When
       there are multiple input files, ffmpeg tries to keep them synchronized
       by tracking lowest timestamp on any active input stream.

       Encoded packets are then passed to the decoder (unless streamcopy is
       selected for the stream, see further for a description). The decoder
       produces uncompressed frames (raw video/PCM audio/...) which can be
       processed further by filtering (see next section). After filtering the
       frames are passed to the encoder, which encodes them and outputs
       encoded packets again. Finally those are passed to the muxer, which
       writes the encoded packets to the output file.

**   Filtering
       Before encoding, ffmpeg can process raw audio and video frames using
       filters from the libavfilter library. Several chained filters form a
       filter graph.  ffmpeg distinguishes between two types of filtergraphs -
       simple and complex.

       Simple filtergraphs

       Simple filtergraphs are those that have exactly one input and output,
       both of the same type. In the above diagram they can be represented by
       simply inserting an additional step between decoding and encoding:

                _________                        __________              ______________
               |         |                      |          |            |              |
               | decoded |  simple filtergraph  | filtered |  encoder   | encoded data |
               | frames  | -------------------> | frames   | ---------> | packets      |
               |_________|                      |__________|            |______________|

       Simple filtergraphs are configured with the per-stream -filter option
       (with -vf and -af aliases for video and audio respectively).  A simple
       filtergraph for video can look for example like this:

                _______        _____________        _______        _____        ________
               |       |      |             |      |       |      |     |      |        |
               | input | ---> | deinterlace | ---> | scale | ---> | fps | ---> | output |
               |_______|      |_____________|      |_______|      |_____|      |________|

       Note that some filters change frame properties but not frame contents.
       E.g. the "fps" filter in the example above changes number of frames,
       but does not touch the frame contents. Another example is the "setpts"
       filter, which only sets timestamps and otherwise passes the frames
       unchanged.

       Complex filtergraphs

       Complex filtergraphs are those which cannot be described as simply a
       linear processing chain applied to one stream. This is the case e.g.
       when the graph has more than one input and/or output, or when output
       stream type is different from input. They can be represented with the
       following diagram:

                _________
               |         |
               | input 0 |\                    __________
               |_________| \                  |          |
                            \   _________    /| output 0 |
                             \ |         |  / |__________|
                _________     \| complex | /
               |         |     |         |/
               | input 1 |---->| filter  |\
               |_________|     |         | \   __________
                              /| graph   |  \ |          |
                             / |         |   \| output 1 |
                _________   /  |_________|    |__________|
               |         | /
               | input 2 |/
               |_________|

       Complex filtergraphs are configured with the -filter_complex option.
       Note that this option is global, since a complex filtergraph by its
       nature cannot be unambiguously associated with a single stream or file.

       A trivial example of a complex filtergraph is the "overlay" filter,
       which has two video inputs and one video output, containing one video
       overlaid on top of the other. Its audio counterpart is the "amix"
       filter.

**   Stream copy
       Stream copy is a mode selected by supplying the "copy" parameter to the
       -codec option. It makes ffmpeg omit the decoding and encoding step for
       the specified stream, so it does only demuxing and muxing. It is useful
       for changing the container format or modifying container-level
       metadata. The diagram above will in this case simplify to this:

                _______              ______________            ________
               |       |            |              |          |        |
               | input |  demuxer   | encoded data |  muxer   | output |
               | file  | ---------> | packets      | -------> | file   |
               |_______|            |______________|          |________|

       Since there is no decoding or encoding, it is very fast and there is no
       quality loss. However it might not work in some cases because of many
       factors. Applying filters is obviously also impossible, since filters
       work on uncompressed data.

* STREAM SELECTION
       By default ffmpeg includes only one stream of each type (video, audio,
       subtitle) present in the input files and adds them to each output file.
       It picks the "best" of each based upon the following criteria; for
       video it is the stream with the highest resolution, for audio the
       stream with the most channels, for subtitle it's the first subtitle
       stream. In the case where several streams of the same type rate
       equally, the lowest numbered stream is chosen.

       You can disable some of those defaults by using "-vn/-an/-sn" options.
       For full manual control, use the "-map" option, which disables the
       defaults just described.

* OPTIONS
       All the numerical options, if not specified otherwise, accept in input
       a string representing a number, which may contain one of the
       International System number postfixes, for example 'K', 'M', 'G'.  If
       'i' is appended after the postfix, powers of 2 are used instead of
       powers of 10. The 'B' postfix multiplies the value for 8, and can be
       appended after another postfix or used alone. This allows using for
       example 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as postfix.

       Options which do not take arguments are boolean options, and set the
       corresponding value to true. They can be set to false by prefixing with
       "no" the option name, for example using "-nofoo" in the command line
       will set to false the boolean option with name "foo".

**   Stream specifiers
       Some options are applied per-stream, e.g. bitrate or codec. Stream
       specifiers are used to precisely specify which stream(s) does a given
       option belong to.

       A stream specifier is a string generally appended to the option name
       and separated from it by a colon. E.g. "-codec:a:1 ac3" option contains
       "a:1" stream specifier, which matches the second audio stream.
       Therefore it would select the ac3 codec for the second audio stream.

       A stream specifier can match several streams, the option is then
       applied to all of them. E.g. the stream specifier in "-b:a 128k"
       matches all audio streams.

       An empty stream specifier matches all streams, for example "-codec
       copy" or "-codec: copy" would copy all the streams without reencoding.

       Possible forms of stream specifiers are:

       stream_index
           Matches the stream with this index. E.g. "-threads:1 4" would set
           the thread count for the second stream to 4.

       stream_type[:stream_index]
           stream_type is one of: 'v' for video, 'a' for audio, 's' for
           subtitle, 'd' for data and 't' for attachments. If stream_index is
           given, then matches stream number stream_index of this type.
           Otherwise matches all streams of this type.

       p:program_id[:stream_index]
           If stream_index is given, then matches stream number stream_index
           in program with id program_id. Otherwise matches all streams in
           this program.

       #stream_id
           Matches the stream by format-specific ID.

**   Generic options
       These options are shared amongst the av* tools.

           Show all codecs known to libavcodec.

           Note that the term 'codec' is used throughout this documentation as
           a shortcut for what is more correctly called a media bitstream
           format.

           Show channel names and standard channel layouts.

***       -loglevel loglevel | -v loglevel
           Set the logging level used by the library.  loglevel is a number or
           a string containing one of the following values:

           quiet
           panic
           fatal
           error
           warning
           info
           verbose
           debug

           By default the program logs to stderr, if coloring is supported by
           the terminal, colors are used to mark errors and warnings. Log
           coloring can be disabled setting the environment variable
           AV_LOG_FORCE_NOCOLOR or NO_COLOR, or can be forced setting the
           environment variable AV_LOG_FORCE_COLOR.  The use of the
           environment variable NO_COLOR is deprecated and will be dropped in
           a following FFmpeg version.

***       -report
           Dump full command line and console output to a file named
           "program-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.log" in the current directory.  This file
           can be useful for bug reports.  It also implies "-loglevel
           verbose".

           Setting the environment variable "FFREPORT" to any value has the
           same effect. If the value is a ':'-separated key=value sequence,
           these options will affect the report; options values must be
           quoting_and_escaping, escaped if they contain special characters or
           the options delimiter ':'. The following option is recognized:

           file
               set the file name to use for the report; %p is expanded to the
               name of the program, %t is expanded to a timestamp, "%%" is
               expanded to a plain "%"

           Errors in parsing the environment variable are not fatal, and will
           not appear in the report.

***       -cpuflags flags (global)
           Allows setting and clearing cpu flags. This option is intended for
           testing. Do not use it unless you know what you're doing.

                   ffmpeg -cpuflags -sse+mmx ...
                   ffmpeg -cpuflags mmx ...
                   ffmpeg -cpuflags 0 ...

**   AVOptions
       These options are provided directly by the libavformat, libavdevice and
       libavcodec libraries. To see the list of available AVOptions, use the
       -help option. They are separated into two categories:

***       generic
           These options can be set for any container, codec or device.
           Generic options are listed under AVFormatContext options for
           containers/devices and under AVCodecContext options for codecs.

***       private
           These options are specific to the given container, device or codec.
           Private options are listed under their corresponding
           containers/devices/codecs.

       For example to write an ID3v2.3 header instead of a default ID3v2.4 to
       an MP3 file, use the id3v2_version private option of the MP3 muxer:

               ffmpeg -i input.flac -id3v2_version 3 out.mp3

       All codec AVOptions are obviously per-stream, so the chapter on stream
       specifiers applies to them

       Note -nooption syntax cannot be used for boolean AVOptions, use -option
       0/-option 1.

       Note2 old undocumented way of specifying per-stream AVOptions by
       prepending v/a/s to the options name is now obsolete and will be
       removed soon.

**   Codec AVOptions
***       -b[:stream_specifier] integer (output,audio,video)
           set bitrate (in bits/s)

***       -ab[:stream_specifier] integer (output,audio)
           set bitrate (in bits/s)

***       -bt[:stream_specifier] integer (output,video)
           Set video bitrate tolerance (in bits/s). In 1-pass mode, bitrate
           tolerance specifies how far ratecontrol is willing to deviate from
           the target average bitrate value. This is not related to min/max
           bitrate. Lowering tolerance too much has an adverse effect on
           quality.

***       -flags[:stream_specifier] flags (input/output,audio,video,subtitles)
           Possible values:

***       -use_wallclock_as_timestamps integer (input)
           use wallclock as timestamps

***       -avoid_negative_ts integer (output)
           avoid negative timestamps

**   Main options
***       -f fmt (input/output)
           Force input or output file format. The format is normally auto
           detected for input files and guessed from file extension for output
           files, so this option is not needed in most cases.

***       -i filename (input)
           input file name

***       -y (global)
           Overwrite output files without asking.

***       -n (global)
           Do not overwrite output files but exit if file exists.

***       -c[:stream_specifier] codec (input/output,per-stream)
***       -codec[:stream_specifier] codec (input/output,per-stream)
           Select an encoder (when used before an output file) or a decoder
           (when used before an input file) for one or more streams. codec is
           the name of a decoder/encoder or a special value "copy" (output
           only) to indicate that the stream is not to be re-encoded.

           For example

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c:v libx264 -c:a copy OUTPUT

           encodes all video streams with libx264 and copies all audio
           streams.

           For each stream, the last matching "c" option is applied, so

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -c copy -c:v:1 libx264 -c:a:137 libvorbis OUTPUT

           will copy all the streams except the second video, which will be
           encoded with libx264, and the 138th audio, which will be encoded
           with libvorbis.

***       -t duration (output)
           Stop writing the output after its duration reaches duration.
           duration may be a number in seconds, or in "hh:mm:ss[.xxx]" form.

***       -fs limit_size (output)
           Set the file size limit, expressed in bytes.

***       -ss position (input/output)
           When used as an input option (before "-i"), seeks in this input
           file to position. When used as an output option (before an output
           filename), decodes but discards input until the timestamps reach
           position. This is slower, but more accurate.

           position may be either in seconds or in "hh:mm:ss[.xxx]" form.

***       -itsoffset offset (input)
           Set the input time offset in seconds.  "[-]hh:mm:ss[.xxx]" syntax
           is also supported.  The offset is added to the timestamps of the
           input files.  Specifying a positive offset means that the
           corresponding streams are delayed by offset seconds.

***       -timestamp time (output)
           Set the recording timestamp in the container.  The syntax for time
           is:

                   now|([(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...])|(HHMMSS[.m...]))[Z|z])

           If the value is "now" it takes the current time.  Time is local
           time unless 'Z' or 'z' is appended, in which case it is interpreted
           as UTC.  If the year-month-day part is not specified it takes the
           current year-month-day.

***       -metadata[:metadata_specifier] key=value (output,per-metadata)
           Set a metadata key/value pair.

           An optional metadata_specifier may be given to set metadata on
           streams or chapters. See "-map_metadata" documentation for details.

           This option overrides metadata set with "-map_metadata". It is also
           possible to delete metadata by using an empty value.

           For example, for setting the title in the output file:

                   ffmpeg -i in.avi -metadata title="my title" out.flv

           To set the language of the first audio stream:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -metadata:s:a:1 language=eng OUTPUT

***       -target type (output)
           Specify target file type ("vcd", "svcd", "dvd", "dv", "dv50"). type
           may be prefixed with "pal-", "ntsc-" or "film-" to use the
           corresponding standard. All the format options (bitrate, codecs,
           buffer sizes) are then set automatically. You can just type:

                   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd /tmp/vcd.mpg

           Nevertheless you can specify additional options as long as you know
           they do not conflict with the standard, as in:

                   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -target vcd -bf 2 /tmp/vcd.mpg

***       -dframes number (output)
           Set the number of data frames to record. This is an alias for
           "-frames:d".

***       -frames[:stream_specifier] framecount (output,per-stream)
           Stop writing to the stream after framecount frames.

***       -q[:stream_specifier] q (output,per-stream)
***       -qscale[:stream_specifier] q (output,per-stream)
           Use fixed quality scale (VBR). The meaning of q is codec-dependent.

***       -filter[:stream_specifier] filter_graph (output,per-stream)
           filter_graph is a description of the filter graph to apply to the
           stream. Use "-filters" to show all the available filters (including
           also sources and sinks).

           See also the -filter_complex option if you want to create filter
           graphs with multiple inputs and/or outputs.

***       -pre[:stream_specifier] preset_name (output,per-stream)
           Specify the preset for matching stream(s).

***       -stats (global)
           Print encoding progress/statistics. On by default.

***       -progress url (global)
           Send program-friendly progress information to url.

           Progress information is written approximately every second and at
           the end of the encoding process. It is made of "key=value" lines.
           key consists of only alphanumeric characters. The last key of a
           sequence of progress information is always "progress".

***       -stdin
           Enable interaction on standard input. On by default unless standard
           input is used as an input. To explicitly disable interaction you
           need to specify "-nostdin".

           Disabling interaction on standard input is useful, for example, if
           ffmpeg is in the background process group. Roughly the same result
           can be achieved with "ffmpeg ... < /dev/null" but it requires a
           shell.

***       -debug_ts (global)
           Print timestamp information. It is off by default. This option is
           mostly useful for testing and debugging purposes, and the output
           format may change from one version to another, so it should not be
           employed by portable scripts.

           See also the option "-fdebug ts".

***       -attach filename (output)
           Add an attachment to the output file. This is supported by a few
           formats like Matroska for e.g. fonts used in rendering subtitles.
           Attachments are implemented as a specific type of stream, so this
           option will add a new stream to the file. It is then possible to
           use per-stream options on this stream in the usual way. Attachment
           streams created with this option will be created after all the
           other streams (i.e. those created with "-map" or automatic
           mappings).

           Note that for Matroska you also have to set the mimetype metadata
           tag:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -attach DejaVuSans.ttf -metadata:s:2 mimetype=application/x-truetype-font out.mkv

           (assuming that the attachment stream will be third in the output
           file).

***       -dump_attachment[:stream_specifier] filename (input,per-stream)
           Extract the matching attachment stream into a file named filename.
           If filename is empty, then the value of the "filename" metadata tag
           will be used.

           E.g. to extract the first attachment to a file named 'out.ttf':

                   ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t:0 out.ttf INPUT

           To extract all attachments to files determined by the "filename"
           tag:

                   ffmpeg -dump_attachment:t "" INPUT

           Technical note -- attachments are implemented as codec extradata,
           so this option can actually be used to extract extradata from any
           stream, not just attachments.

**   Video Options
***       -vframes number (output)
           Set the number of video frames to record. This is an alias for
           "-frames:v".

***       -r[:stream_specifier] fps (input/output,per-stream)
           Set frame rate (Hz value, fraction or abbreviation).

           As an input option, ignore any timestamps stored in the file and
           instead generate timestamps assuming constant frame rate fps.

           As an output option, duplicate or drop input frames to achieve
           constant output frame rate fps (note that this actually causes the
           "fps" filter to be inserted to the end of the corresponding
           filtergraph).

***       -s[:stream_specifier] size (input/output,per-stream)
           Set frame size.

           As an input option, this is a shortcut for the video_size private
           option, recognized by some demuxers for which the frame size is
           either not stored in the file or is configurable -- e.g. raw video
           or video grabbers.

           As an output option, this inserts the "scale" video filter to the
           end of the corresponding filtergraph. Please use the "scale" filter
           directly to insert it at the beginning or some other place.

           The format is wxh (default - same as source).

***       -aspect[:stream_specifier] aspect (output,per-stream)
           Set the video display aspect ratio specified by aspect.

           aspect can be a floating point number string, or a string of the
           form num:den, where num and den are the numerator and denominator
           of the aspect ratio. For example "4:3", "16:9", "1.3333", and
           "1.7777" are valid argument values.

***       -croptop size
***       -cropbottom size
***       -cropleft size
***       -cropright size
           All the crop options have been removed. Use -vf
           crop=width:height:x:y instead.

***       -padtop size
***       -padbottom size
***       -padleft size
***       -padright size
***       -padcolor hex_color
           All the pad options have been removed. Use -vf
           pad=width:height:x:y:color instead.

***       -vn (output)
           Disable video recording.

***       -vcodec codec (output)
           Set the video codec. This is an alias for "-codec:v".

***       -pass[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)
           Select the pass number (1 or 2). It is used to do two-pass video
           encoding. The statistics of the video are recorded in the first
           pass into a log file (see also the option -passlogfile), and in the
           second pass that log file is used to generate the video at the
           exact requested bitrate.  On pass 1, you may just deactivate audio
           and set output to null, examples for Windows and Unix:

                   ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y NUL
                   ffmpeg -i foo.mov -c:v libxvid -pass 1 -an -f rawvideo -y /dev/null

***       -passlogfile[:stream_specifier] prefix (output,per-stream)
           Set two-pass log file name prefix to prefix, the default file name
           prefix is ``ffmpeg2pass''. The complete file name will be
           PREFIX-N.log, where N is a number specific to the output stream

***       -vlang code
           Set the ISO 639 language code (3 letters) of the current video
           stream.

***       -vf filter_graph (output)
           filter_graph is a description of the filter graph to apply to the
           input video.  Use the option "-filters" to show all the available
           filters (including also sources and sinks).  This is an alias for
           "-filter:v".

**   Advanced Video Options
***       -pix_fmt[:stream_specifier] format (input/output,per-stream)
           Set pixel format. Use "-pix_fmts" to show all the supported pixel
           formats.  If the selected pixel format can not be selected, ffmpeg
           will print a warning and select the best pixel format supported by
           the encoder.  If pix_fmt is prefixed by a "+", ffmpeg will exit
           with an error if the requested pixel format can not be selected,
           and automatic conversions inside filter graphs are disabled.  If
           pix_fmt is a single "+", ffmpeg selects the same pixel format as
           the input (or graph output) and automatic conversions are disabled.

***       -sws_flags flags (input/output)
           Set SwScaler flags.

***       -vdt n
           Discard threshold.

***       -rc_override[:stream_specifier] override (output,per-stream)
           Rate control override for specific intervals, formatted as
           "int,int,int" list separated with slashes. Two first values are the
           beginning and end frame numbers, last one is quantizer to use if
           positive, or quality factor if negative.

***       -deinterlace
           Deinterlace pictures.  This option is deprecated since the
           deinterlacing is very low quality.  Use the yadif filter with
           "-filter:v yadif".

       -ilme
           Force interlacing support in encoder (MPEG-2 and MPEG-4 only).  Use
           this option if your input file is interlaced and you want to keep
           the interlaced format for minimum losses.  The alternative is to
           deinterlace the input stream with -deinterlace, but deinterlacing
           introduces losses.

       -psnr
           Calculate PSNR of compressed frames.

       -vstats
           Dump video coding statistics to vstats_HHMMSS.log.

       -vstats_file file
           Dump video coding statistics to file.

       -top[:stream_specifier] n (output,per-stream)
           top=1/bottom=0/auto=-1 field first

       -dc precision
           Intra_dc_precision.

       -vtag fourcc/tag (output)
           Force video tag/fourcc. This is an alias for "-tag:v".

       -qphist (global)
           Show QP histogram

       -vbsf bitstream_filter
           Deprecated see -bsf

       -force_key_frames[:stream_specifier] time[,time...] (output,per-stream)
           Force key frames at the specified timestamps, more precisely at the
           first frames after each specified time.  This option can be useful
           to ensure that a seek point is present at a chapter mark or any
           other designated place in the output file.  The timestamps must be
           specified in ascending order.

       -copyinkf[:stream_specifier] (output,per-stream)
           When doing stream copy, copy also non-key frames found at the
           beginning.

**   Audio Options
       -aframes number (output)
           Set the number of audio frames to record. This is an alias for
           "-frames:a".

       -ar[:stream_specifier] freq (input/output,per-stream)
           Set the audio sampling frequency. For output streams it is set by
           default to the frequency of the corresponding input stream. For
           input streams this option only makes sense for audio grabbing
           devices and raw demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer
           options.

       -aq q (output)
           Set the audio quality (codec-specific, VBR). This is an alias for
           -q:a.

       -ac[:stream_specifier] channels (input/output,per-stream)
           Set the number of audio channels. For output streams it is set by
           default to the number of input audio channels. For input streams
           this option only makes sense for audio grabbing devices and raw
           demuxers and is mapped to the corresponding demuxer options.

       -an (output)
           Disable audio recording.

       -acodec codec (input/output)
           Set the audio codec. This is an alias for "-codec:a".

       -sample_fmt[:stream_specifier] sample_fmt (output,per-stream)
           Set the audio sample format. Use "-sample_fmts" to get a list of
           supported sample formats.

       -af filter_graph (output)
           filter_graph is a description of the filter graph to apply to the
           input audio.  Use the option "-filters" to show all the available
           filters (including also sources and sinks).  This is an alias for
           "-filter:a".

**   Advanced Audio options:
       -atag fourcc/tag (output)
           Force audio tag/fourcc. This is an alias for "-tag:a".

       -absf bitstream_filter
           Deprecated, see -bsf

**   Subtitle options:
       -slang code
           Set the ISO 639 language code (3 letters) of the current subtitle
           stream.

       -scodec codec (input/output)
           Set the subtitle codec. This is an alias for "-codec:s".

       -sn (output)
           Disable subtitle recording.

       -sbsf bitstream_filter
           Deprecated, see -bsf

**   Advanced Subtitle options:
       -fix_sub_duration
           Fix subtitles durations. For each subtitle, wait for the next
           packet in the same stream and adjust the duration of the first to
           avoid overlap. This is necessary with some subtitles codecs,
           especially DVB subtitles, because the duration in the original
           packet is only a rough estimate and the end is actually marked by
           an empty subtitle frame. Failing to use this option when necessary
           can result in exaggerated durations or muxing failures due to non-
           monotonic timestamps.

           Note that this option will delay the output of all data until the
           next subtitle packet is decoded: it may increase memory consumption
           and latency a lot.

**   Advanced options
       -map
       [-]input_file_id[:stream_specifier][,sync_file_id[:stream_specifier]] |
       [linklabel] (output)
           Designate one or more input streams as a source for the output
           file. Each input stream is identified by the input file index
           input_file_id and the input stream index input_stream_id within the
           input file. Both indices start at 0. If specified,
           sync_file_id:stream_specifier sets which input stream is used as a
           presentation sync reference.

           The first "-map" option on the command line specifies the source
           for output stream 0, the second "-map" option specifies the source
           for output stream 1, etc.

           A "-" character before the stream identifier creates a "negative"
           mapping.  It disables matching streams from already created
           mappings.

           An alternative [linklabel] form will map outputs from complex
           filter graphs (see the -filter_complex option) to the output file.
           linklabel must correspond to a defined output link label in the
           graph.

           For example, to map ALL streams from the first input file to output

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 output

           For example, if you have two audio streams in the first input file,
           these streams are identified by "0:0" and "0:1". You can use "-map"
           to select which streams to place in an output file. For example:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:1 out.wav

           will map the input stream in INPUT identified by "0:1" to the
           (single) output stream in out.wav.

           For example, to select the stream with index 2 from input file
           a.mov (specified by the identifier "0:2"), and stream with index 6
           from input b.mov (specified by the identifier "1:6"), and copy them
           to the output file out.mov:

                   ffmpeg -i a.mov -i b.mov -c copy -map 0:2 -map 1:6 out.mov

           To select all video and the third audio stream from an input file:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0:v -map 0:a:2 OUTPUT

           To map all the streams except the second audio, use negative
           mappings

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map 0 -map -0:a:1 OUTPUT

           Note that using this option disables the default mappings for this
           output file.

       -map_channel
       [input_file_id.stream_specifier.channel_id|-1][:output_file_id.stream_specifier]
           Map an audio channel from a given input to an output. If
           output_file_id.stream_specifier is not set, the audio channel will
           be mapped on all the audio streams.

           Using "-1" instead of input_file_id.stream_specifier.channel_id
           will map a muted channel.

           For example, assuming INPUT is a stereo audio file, you can switch
           the two audio channels with the following command:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.1 -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT

           If you want to mute the first channel and keep the second:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel -1 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT

           The order of the "-map_channel" option specifies the order of the
           channels in the output stream. The output channel layout is guessed
           from the number of channels mapped (mono if one "-map_channel",
           stereo if two, etc.). Using "-ac" in combination of "-map_channel"
           makes the channel gain levels to be updated if input and output
           channel layouts don't match (for instance two "-map_channel"
           options and "-ac 6").

           You can also extract each channel of an input to specific outputs;
           the following command extracts two channels of the INPUT audio
           stream (file 0, stream 0) to the respective OUTPUT_CH0 and
           OUTPUT_CH1 outputs:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -map_channel 0.0.0 OUTPUT_CH0 -map_channel 0.0.1 OUTPUT_CH1

           The following example splits the channels of a stereo input into
           two separate streams, which are put into the same output file:

                   ffmpeg -i stereo.wav -map 0:0 -map 0:0 -map_channel 0.0.0:0.0 -map_channel 0.0.1:0.1 -y out.ogg

           Note that currently each output stream can only contain channels
           from a single input stream; you can't for example use
           "-map_channel" to pick multiple input audio channels contained in
           different streams (from the same or different files) and merge them
           into a single output stream. It is therefore not currently
           possible, for example, to turn two separate mono streams into a
           single stereo stream. However splitting a stereo stream into two
           single channel mono streams is possible.

           If you need this feature, a possible workaround is to use the
           amerge filter. For example, if you need to merge a media (here
           input.mkv) with 2 mono audio streams into one single stereo channel
           audio stream (and keep the video stream), you can use the following
           command:

                   ffmpeg -i input.mkv -filter_complex "[0:1] [0:2] amerge" -c:a pcm_s16le -c:v copy output.mkv

       -map_metadata[:metadata_spec_out] infile[:metadata_spec_in]
       (output,per-metadata)
           Set metadata information of the next output file from infile. Note
           that those are file indices (zero-based), not filenames.  Optional
           metadata_spec_in/out parameters specify, which metadata to copy.  A
           metadata specifier can have the following forms:

           g   global metadata, i.e. metadata that applies to the whole file

           s[:stream_spec]
               per-stream metadata. stream_spec is a stream specifier as
               described in the Stream specifiers chapter. In an input
               metadata specifier, the first matching stream is copied from.
               In an output metadata specifier, all matching streams are
               copied to.

           c:chapter_index
               per-chapter metadata. chapter_index is the zero-based chapter
               index.

           p:program_index
               per-program metadata. program_index is the zero-based program
               index.

           If metadata specifier is omitted, it defaults to global.

           By default, global metadata is copied from the first input file,
           per-stream and per-chapter metadata is copied along with
           streams/chapters. These default mappings are disabled by creating
           any mapping of the relevant type. A negative file index can be used
           to create a dummy mapping that just disables automatic copying.

           For example to copy metadata from the first stream of the input
           file to global metadata of the output file:

                   ffmpeg -i in.ogg -map_metadata 0:s:0 out.mp3

           To do the reverse, i.e. copy global metadata to all audio streams:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -map_metadata:s:a 0:g out.mkv

           Note that simple 0 would work as well in this example, since global
           metadata is assumed by default.

       -map_chapters input_file_index (output)
           Copy chapters from input file with index input_file_index to the
           next output file. If no chapter mapping is specified, then chapters
           are copied from the first input file with at least one chapter. Use
           a negative file index to disable any chapter copying.

       -benchmark (global)
           Show benchmarking information at the end of an encode.  Shows CPU
           time used and maximum memory consumption.  Maximum memory
           consumption is not supported on all systems, it will usually
           display as 0 if not supported.

       -benchmark_all (global)
           Show benchmarking information during the encode.  Shows CPU time
           used in various steps (audio/video encode/decode).

       -timelimit duration (global)
           Exit after ffmpeg has been running for duration seconds.

       -dump (global)
           Dump each input packet to stderr.

       -hex (global)
           When dumping packets, also dump the payload.

       -re (input)
           Read input at native frame rate. Mainly used to simulate a grab
           device.  By default ffmpeg attempts to read the input(s) as fast as
           possible.  This option will slow down the reading of the input(s)
           to the native frame rate of the input(s). It is useful for real-
           time output (e.g. live streaming). If your input(s) is coming from
           some other live streaming source (through HTTP or UDP for example)
           the server might already be in real-time, thus the option will
           likely not be required. On the other hand, this is meaningful if
           your input(s) is a file you are trying to push in real-time.

       -loop_input
           Loop over the input stream. Currently it works only for image
           streams. This option is used for automatic FFserver testing.  This
           option is deprecated, use -loop 1.

       -loop_output number_of_times
           Repeatedly loop output for formats that support looping such as
           animated GIF (0 will loop the output infinitely).  This option is
           deprecated, use -loop.

***       -vsync parameter
           Video sync method.  For compatibility reasons old values can be
           specified as numbers.  Newly added values will have to be specified
           as strings always.

           0, passthrough
               Each frame is passed with its timestamp from the demuxer to the
               muxer.

           1, cfr
               Frames will be duplicated and dropped to achieve exactly the
               requested constant framerate.

           2, vfr
               Frames are passed through with their timestamp or dropped so as
               to prevent 2 frames from having the same timestamp.

           drop
               As passthrough but destroys all timestamps, making the muxer
               generate fresh timestamps based on frame-rate.

           -1, auto
               Chooses between 1 and 2 depending on muxer capabilities. This
               is the default method.

           With -map you can select from which stream the timestamps should be
           taken. You can leave either video or audio unchanged and sync the
           remaining stream(s) to the unchanged one.

       -async samples_per_second
           Audio sync method. "Stretches/squeezes" the audio stream to match
           the timestamps, the parameter is the maximum samples per second by
           which the audio is changed.  -async 1 is a special case where only
           the start of the audio stream is corrected without any later
           correction.  This option has been deprecated. Use the "asyncts"
           audio filter instead.

       -copyts
           Copy timestamps from input to output.

***       -copytb mode
           Specify how to set the encoder timebase when stream copying.  mode
           is an integer numeric value, and can assume one of the following
           values:

           1   Use the demuxer timebase.

               The time base is copied to the output encoder from the
               corresponding input demuxer. This is sometimes required to
               avoid non monotonically increasing timestamps when copying
               video streams with variable frame rate.

           0   Use the decoder timebase.

               The time base is copied to the output encoder from the
               corresponding input decoder.

           -1  Try to make the choice automatically, in order to generate a
               sane output.

           Default value is -1.

       -shortest (output)
           Finish encoding when the shortest input stream ends.

***       -dts_delta_threshold
           Timestamp discontinuity delta threshold.

***       -muxdelay seconds (input)
           Set the maximum demux-decode delay.

***       -muxpreload seconds (input)
           Set the initial demux-decode delay.

***       -streamid output-stream-index:new-value (output)
           Assign a new stream-id value to an output stream. This option
           should be specified prior to the output filename to which it
           applies.  For the situation where multiple output files exist, a
           streamid may be reassigned to a different value.

           For example, to set the stream 0 PID to 33 and the stream 1 PID to
           36 for an output mpegts file:

                   ffmpeg -i infile -streamid 0:33 -streamid 1:36 out.ts

***       -bsf[:stream_specifier] bitstream_filters (output,per-stream)
           Set bitstream filters for matching streams. bistream_filters is a
           comma-separated list of bitstream filters. Use the "-bsfs" option
           to get the list of bitstream filters.

                   ffmpeg -i h264.mp4 -c:v copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb -an out.h264

                   ffmpeg -i file.mov -an -vn -bsf:s mov2textsub -c:s copy -f rawvideo sub.txt

***       -tag[:stream_specifier] codec_tag (per-stream)
           Force a tag/fourcc for matching streams.

***       -timecode hh:mm:ssSEPff
           Specify Timecode for writing. SEP is ':' for non drop timecode and
           ';' (or '.') for drop.

                   ffmpeg -i input.mpg -timecode 01:02:03.04 -r 30000/1001 -s ntsc output.mpg

***       -filter_complex filtergraph (global)
           Define a complex filter graph, i.e. one with arbitrary number of
           inputs and/or outputs. For simple graphs -- those with one input
           and one output of the same type -- see the -filter options.
           filtergraph is a description of the filter graph, as described in
           Filtergraph syntax.

           Input link labels must refer to input streams using the
           "[file_index:stream_specifier]" syntax (i.e. the same as -map
           uses). If stream_specifier matches multiple streams, the first one
           will be used. An unlabeled input will be connected to the first
           unused input stream of the matching type.

           Output link labels are referred to with -map. Unlabeled outputs are
           added to the first output file.

           Note that with this option it is possible to use only lavfi sources
           without normal input files.

           For example, to overlay an image over video

                   ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex '[0:v][1:v]overlay[out]' -map
                   '[out]' out.mkv

           Here "[0:v]" refers to the first video stream in the first input
           file, which is linked to the first (main) input of the overlay
           filter. Similarly the first video stream in the second input is
           linked to the second (overlay) input of overlay.

           Assuming there is only one video stream in each input file, we can
           omit input labels, so the above is equivalent to

                   ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay[out]' -map
                   '[out]' out.mkv

           Furthermore we can omit the output label and the single output from
           the filter graph will be added to the output file automatically, so
           we can simply write

                   ffmpeg -i video.mkv -i image.png -filter_complex 'overlay' out.mkv

           To generate 5 seconds of pure red video using lavfi "color" source:

                   ffmpeg -filter_complex 'color=red' -t 5 out.mkv

       As a special exception, you can use a bitmap subtitle stream as input:
       it will be converted into a video with the same size as the largest
       video in the file, or 720X576 if no video is present. Note that this is
       an experimental and temporary solution. It will be removed once
       libavfilter has proper support for subtitles.

       For example, to hardcode subtitles on top of a DVB-T recording stored
       in MPEG-TS format, delaying the subtitles by 1 second:

               ffmpeg -i input.ts -filter_complex \
                 '[#0x2ef] setpts=PTS+1/TB [sub] ; [#0x2d0] [sub] overlay' \
                 -sn -map '#0x2dc' output.mkv

       (0x2d0, 0x2dc and 0x2ef are the MPEG-TS PIDs of respectively the video,
       audio and subtitles streams; 0:0, 0:3 and 0:7 would have worked too)

**   Preset files
       A preset file contains a sequence of option=value pairs, one for each
       line, specifying a sequence of options which would be awkward to
       specify on the command line. Lines starting with the hash ('#')
       character are ignored and are used to provide comments. Check the
       presets directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

       Preset files are specified with the "vpre", "apre", "spre", and "fpre"
       options. The "fpre" option takes the filename of the preset instead of
       a preset name as input and can be used for any kind of codec. For the
       "vpre", "apre", and "spre" options, the options specified in a preset
       file are applied to the currently selected codec of the same type as
       the preset option.

       The argument passed to the "vpre", "apre", and "spre" preset options
       identifies the preset file to use according to the following rules:

       First ffmpeg searches for a file named arg.ffpreset in the directories
       $FFMPEG_DATADIR (if set), and $HOME/.ffmpeg, and in the datadir defined
       at configuration time (usually PREFIX/share/ffmpeg) or in a ffpresets
       folder along the executable on win32, in that order. For example, if
       the argument is "libvpx-1080p", it will search for the file
       libvpx-1080p.ffpreset.

       If no such file is found, then ffmpeg will search for a file named
       codec_name-arg.ffpreset in the above-mentioned directories, where
       codec_name is the name of the codec to which the preset file options
       will be applied. For example, if you select the video codec with
       "-vcodec libvpx" and use "-vpre 1080p", then it will search for the
       file libvpx-1080p.ffpreset.

* TIPS
       o   For streaming at very low bitrate application, use a low frame rate
           and a small GOP size. This is especially true for RealVideo where
           the Linux player does not seem to be very fast, so it can miss
           frames. An example is:

                   ffmpeg -g 3 -r 3 -t 10 -b:v 50k -s qcif -f rv10 /tmp/b.rm

       o   The parameter 'q' which is displayed while encoding is the current
           quantizer. The value 1 indicates that a very good quality could be
           achieved. The value 31 indicates the worst quality. If q=31 appears
           too often, it means that the encoder cannot compress enough to meet
           your bitrate. You must either increase the bitrate, decrease the
           frame rate or decrease the frame size.

       o   If your computer is not fast enough, you can speed up the
           compression at the expense of the compression ratio. You can use
           '-me zero' to speed up motion estimation, and '-g 0' to disable
           motion estimation completely (you have only I-frames, which means
           it is about as good as JPEG compression).

       o   To have very low audio bitrates, reduce the sampling frequency
           (down to 22050 Hz for MPEG audio, 22050 or 11025 for AC-3).

       o   To have a constant quality (but a variable bitrate), use the option
           '-qscale n' when 'n' is between 1 (excellent quality) and 31 (worst
           quality).

* EXAMPLES
   Preset files
       A preset file contains a sequence of option=value pairs, one for each
       line, specifying a sequence of options which can be specified also on
       the command line. Lines starting with the hash ('#') character are
       ignored and are used to provide comments. Empty lines are also ignored.
       Check the presets directory in the FFmpeg source tree for examples.

       Preset files are specified with the "pre" option, this option takes a
       preset name as input.  FFmpeg searches for a file named
       preset_name.avpreset in the directories $AVCONV_DATADIR (if set), and
       $HOME/.ffmpeg, and in the data directory defined at configuration time
       (usually $PREFIX/share/ffmpeg) in that order.  For example, if the
       argument is "libx264-max", it will search for the file
       libx264-max.avpreset.

   Video and Audio grabbing
       If you specify the input format and device then ffmpeg can grab video
       and audio directly.

               ffmpeg -f oss -i /dev/dsp -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg

       Or with an ALSA audio source (mono input, card id 1) instead of OSS:

               ffmpeg -f alsa -ac 1 -i hw:1 -f video4linux2 -i /dev/video0 /tmp/out.mpg

       Note that you must activate the right video source and channel before
       launching ffmpeg with any TV viewer such as
        xawtv ("http://linux.bytesex.org/xawtv/") by Gerd Knorr. You also have
       to set the audio recording levels correctly with a standard mixer.

   X11 grabbing
       Grab the X11 display with ffmpeg via

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -s cif -r 25 -i :0.0 /tmp/out.mpg

       0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY
       environment variable.

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -s cif -r 25 -i :0.0+10,20 /tmp/out.mpg

       0.0 is display.screen number of your X11 server, same as the DISPLAY
       environment variable. 10 is the x-offset and 20 the y-offset for the
       grabbing.

   Video and Audio file format conversion
       Any supported file format and protocol can serve as input to ffmpeg:

       Examples:

       o   You can use YUV files as input:

                   ffmpeg -i /tmp/test%d.Y /tmp/out.mpg

           It will use the files:

                   /tmp/test0.Y, /tmp/test0.U, /tmp/test0.V,
                   /tmp/test1.Y, /tmp/test1.U, /tmp/test1.V, etc...

           The Y files use twice the resolution of the U and V files. They are
           raw files, without header. They can be generated by all decent
           video decoders. You must specify the size of the image with the -s
           option if ffmpeg cannot guess it.

       o   You can input from a raw YUV420P file:

                   ffmpeg -i /tmp/test.yuv /tmp/out.avi

           test.yuv is a file containing raw YUV planar data. Each frame is
           composed of the Y plane followed by the U and V planes at half
           vertical and horizontal resolution.

       o   You can output to a raw YUV420P file:

                   ffmpeg -i mydivx.avi hugefile.yuv

       o   You can set several input files and output files:

                   ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -s 640x480 -i /tmp/a.yuv /tmp/a.mpg

           Converts the audio file a.wav and the raw YUV video file a.yuv to
           MPEG file a.mpg.

       o   You can also do audio and video conversions at the same time:

                   ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -ar 22050 /tmp/a.mp2

           Converts a.wav to MPEG audio at 22050 Hz sample rate.

       o   You can encode to several formats at the same time and define a
           mapping from input stream to output streams:

                   ffmpeg -i /tmp/a.wav -map 0:a -b:a 64k /tmp/a.mp2 -map 0:a -b:a 128k /tmp/b.mp2

           Converts a.wav to a.mp2 at 64 kbits and to b.mp2 at 128 kbits.
           '-map file:index' specifies which input stream is used for each
           output stream, in the order of the definition of output streams.

       o   You can transcode decrypted VOBs:

                   ffmpeg -i snatch_1.vob -f avi -c:v mpeg4 -b:v 800k -g 300 -bf 2 -c:a libmp3lame -b:a 128k snatch.avi

           This is a typical DVD ripping example; the input is a VOB file, the
           output an AVI file with MPEG-4 video and MP3 audio. Note that in
           this command we use B-frames so the MPEG-4 stream is DivX5
           compatible, and GOP size is 300 which means one intra frame every
           10 seconds for 29.97fps input video. Furthermore, the audio stream
           is MP3-encoded so you need to enable LAME support by passing
           "--enable-libmp3lame" to configure.  The mapping is particularly
           useful for DVD transcoding to get the desired audio language.

           NOTE: To see the supported input formats, use "ffmpeg -formats".

       o   You can extract images from a video, or create a video from many
           images:

           For extracting images from a video:

                   ffmpeg -i foo.avi -r 1 -s WxH -f image2 foo-%03d.jpeg

           This will extract one video frame per second from the video and
           will output them in files named foo-001.jpeg, foo-002.jpeg, etc.
           Images will be rescaled to fit the new WxH values.

           If you want to extract just a limited number of frames, you can use
           the above command in combination with the -vframes or -t option, or
           in combination with -ss to start extracting from a certain point in
           time.

           For creating a video from many images:

                   ffmpeg -f image2 -i foo-%03d.jpeg -r 12 -s WxH foo.avi

           The syntax "foo-%03d.jpeg" specifies to use a decimal number
           composed of three digits padded with zeroes to express the sequence
           number. It is the same syntax supported by the C printf function,
           but only formats accepting a normal integer are suitable.

           When importing an image sequence, -i also supports expanding shell-
           like wildcard patterns (globbing) internally, by selecting the
           image2-specific "-pattern_type glob" option.

           For example, for creating a video from filenames matching the glob
           pattern "foo-*.jpeg":

                   ffmpeg -f image2 -pattern_type glob -i 'foo-*.jpeg' -r 12 -s WxH foo.avi

       o   You can put many streams of the same type in the output:

                   ffmpeg -i test1.avi -i test2.avi -map 0.3 -map 0.2 -map 0.1 -map 0.0 -c copy test12.nut

           The resulting output file test12.avi will contain first four
           streams from the input file in reverse order.

       o   To force CBR video output:

                   ffmpeg -i myfile.avi -b 4000k -minrate 4000k -maxrate 4000k -bufsize 1835k out.m2v

       o   The four options lmin, lmax, mblmin and mblmax use 'lambda' units,
           but you may use the QP2LAMBDA constant to easily convert from 'q'
           units:

                   ffmpeg -i src.ext -lmax 21*QP2LAMBDA dst.ext

* SYNTAX
       This section documents the syntax and formats employed by the FFmpeg
       libraries and tools.

**   Quoting and escaping
       FFmpeg adopts the following quoting and escaping mechanism, unless
       explicitly specified. The following rules are applied:

       o   "'" and "\" are special characters (respectively used for quoting
           and escaping). In addition to them, there might be other special
           characters depending on the specific syntax where the escaping and
           quoting are employed.

       o   A special character is escaped by prefixing it with a '\'.

       o   All characters enclosed between '' are included literally in the
           parsed string. The quote character "'" itself cannot be quoted, so
           you may need to close the quote and escape it.

       o   Leading and trailing whitespaces, unless escaped or quoted, are
           removed from the parsed string.

       Note that you may need to add a second level of escaping when using the
       command line or a script, which depends on the syntax of the adopted
       shell language.

       The function "av_get_token" defined in libavutil/avstring.h can be used
       to parse a token quoted or escaped according to the rules defined
       above.

       The tool tools/ffescape in the FFmpeg source tree can be used to
       automatically quote or escape a string in a script.

       Examples

       o   Escape the string "Crime d'Amour" containing the "'" special
           character:

                   Crime d\'Amour

       o   The string above contains a quote, so the "'" needs to be escaped
           when quoting it:

                   'Crime d'\''Amour'

       o   Include leading or trailing whitespaces using quoting:

                   '  this string starts and ends with whitespaces  '

       o   Escaping and quoting can be mixed together:

                   ' The string '\'string\'' is a string '

       o   To include a literal "\" you can use either escaping or quoting:

                   'c:\foo' can be written as c:\\foo

**   Date
       The accepted syntax is:

               [(YYYY-MM-DD|YYYYMMDD)[T|t| ]]((HH:MM:SS[.m...]]])|(HHMMSS[.m...]]]))[Z]
               now

       If the value is "now" it takes the current time.

       Time is local time unless Z is appended, in which case it is
       interpreted as UTC.  If the year-month-day part is not specified it
       takes the current year-month-day.

**   Time duration
       The accepted syntax is:

               [-]HH:MM:SS[.m...]
               [-]S+[.m...]

       HH expresses the number of hours, MM the number a of minutes and SS the
       number of seconds.

**   Video size
       Specify the size of the sourced video, it may be a string of the form
       widthxheight, or the name of a size abbreviation.

       The following abbreviations are recognized:

       sqcif

**   Video rate
       Specify the frame rate of a video, expressed as the number of frames
       generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
       frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or a
       valid video frame rate abbreviation.

       The following abbreviations are recognized:

       ntsc
           30000/1001

       pal 25/1

       qntsc
           30000/1

       qpal
           25/1

       sntsc
           30000/1

       spal
           25/1

       film
           24/1

       ntsc-film
           24000/1

**   Ratio
       A ratio can be expressed as an expression, or in the form
       numerator:denominator.

       Note that a ratio with infinite (1/0) or negative value is considered
       valid, so you should check on the returned value if you want to exclude
       those values.

       The undefined value can be expressed using the "0:0" string.

**   Color
       It can be the name of a color (case insensitive match) or a
       [0x|#]RRGGBB[AA] sequence, possibly followed by "@" and a string
       representing the alpha component.

       The alpha component may be a string composed by "0x" followed by an
       hexadecimal number or a decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0, which
       represents the opacity value (0x00/0.0 means completely transparent,
       0xff/1.0 completely opaque).  If the alpha component is not specified
       then 0xff is assumed.

       The string "random" will result in a random color.

* EXPRESSION EVALUATION
       When evaluating an arithmetic expression, FFmpeg uses an internal
       formula evaluator, implemented through the libavutil/eval.h interface.

       An expression may contain unary, binary operators, constants, and
       functions.

       Two expressions expr1 and expr2 can be combined to form another
       expression "expr1;expr2".  expr1 and expr2 are evaluated in turn, and
       the new expression evaluates to the value of expr2.

       The following binary operators are available: "+", "-", "*", "/", "^".

       The following unary operators are available: "+", "-".

       The following functions are available:

       sinh(x)
           Compute hyperbolic sine of x.

       cosh(x)
           Compute hyperbolic cosine of x.

       tanh(x)
           Compute hyperbolic tangent of x.

       sin(x)

           sqrt(2*PI)".

       isinf(x)
           Return 1.0 if x is +/-INFINITY, 0.0 otherwise.

       isnan(x)
           Return 1.0 if x is NAN, 0.0 otherwise.

       mod(x, y)
           Compute the remainder of division of x by y.

       max(x, y)
           Return the maximum between x and y.

       min(x, y)
           Return the maximum between x and y.

       eq(x, y)
           Return 1 if x and y are equivalent, 0 otherwise.

       gte(x, y)
           Return 1 if x is greater than or equal to y, 0 otherwise.

       gt(x, y)
           Return 1 if x is greater than y, 0 otherwise.

       lte(x, y)
           Return 1 if x is lesser than or equal to y, 0 otherwise.

       lt(x, y)
           Return 1 if x is lesser than y, 0 otherwise.

       st(var, expr)
           Allow to store the value of the expression expr in an internal
           variable. var specifies the number of the variable where to store
           the value, and it is a value ranging from 0 to 9. The function
           returns the value stored in the internal variable.  Note, Variables
           are currently not shared between expressions.

       ld(var)
           Allow to load the value of the internal variable with number var,
           which was previously stored with st(var, expr).  The function
           returns the loaded value.

       while(cond, expr)
           Evaluate expression expr while the expression cond is non-zero, and
           returns the value of the last expr evaluation, or NAN if cond was
           always false.

       ceil(expr)
           Round the value of expression expr upwards to the nearest integer.
           For example, "ceil(1.5)" is "2.0".

       floor(expr)
           Round the value of expression expr downwards to the nearest
           integer. For example, "floor(-1.5)" is "-2.0".

       trunc(expr)
           Round the value of expression expr towards zero to the nearest
           integer. For example, "trunc(-1.5)" is "-1.0".

       sqrt(expr)
           Compute the square root of expr. This is equivalent to "(expr)^.5".

       not(expr)
           Return 1.0 if expr is zero, 0.0 otherwise.

       pow(x, y)
           Compute the power of x elevated y, it is equivalent to "(x)^(y)".

       random(x)
           Return a pseudo random value between 0.0 and 1.0. x is the index of
           the internal variable which will be used to save the seed/state.

       hypot(x, y)
           This function is similar to the C function with the same name; it
           returns "sqrt(x*x + y*y)", the length of the hypotenuse of a right
           triangle with sides of length x and y, or the distance of the point
           (x, y) from the origin.

       gcd(x, y)
           Return the greatest common divisor of x and y. If both x and y are
           0 or either or both are less than zero then behavior is undefined.

       if(x, y)
           Evaluate x, and if the result is non-zero return the result of the
           evaluation of y, return 0 otherwise.

       ifnot(x, y)
           Evaluate x, and if the result is zero return the result of the
           evaluation of y, return 0 otherwise.

       taylor(expr, x) taylor(expr, x, id)
           Evaluate a taylor series at x.  expr represents the LD(id)-th
           derivates of f(x) at 0. If id is not specified then 0 is assumed.
           note, when you have the derivatives at y instead of 0 taylor(expr,
           x-y) can be used When the series does not converge the results are
           undefined.

       root(expr, max)
           Finds x where f(x)=0 in the interval 0..max.  f() must be
           continuous or the result is undefined.

       The following constants are available:

       PI  area of the unit disc, approximately 3.14

       E   exp(1) (Euler's number), approximately 2.718

       PHI golden ratio (1+sqrt(5))/2, approximately 1.618

       Assuming that an expression is considered "true" if it has a non-zero
       value, note that:

       "*" works like AND

       "+" works like OR

       and the construct:

               if A then B else C

       is equivalent to

               if(A,B) + ifnot(A,C)

       In your C code, you can extend the list of unary and binary functions,
       and define recognized constants, so that they are available for your
       expressions.

       The evaluator also recognizes the International System number
       postfixes. If 'i' is appended after the postfix, powers of 2 are used
       instead of powers of 10. The 'B' postfix multiplies the value for 8,
       and can be appended after another postfix or used alone. This allows
       using for example 'KB', 'MiB', 'G' and 'B' as postfix.

       Follows the list of available International System postfixes, with
       indication of the corresponding powers of 10 and of 2.

* DECODERS
       Decoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the decoding of
       multimedia streams.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native decoders
       are enabled by default. Decoders requiring an external library must be
       enabled manually via the corresponding "--enable-lib" option. You can
       list all available decoders using the configure option
       "--list-decoders".

       You can disable all the decoders with the configure option
       "--disable-decoders" and selectively enable / disable single decoders
       with the options "--enable-decoder=DECODER" /
       "--disable-decoder=DECODER".

       The option "-codecs" of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       decoders.

* VIDEO DECODERS
       A description of some of the currently available video decoders
       follows.

   rawvideo
       Raw video decoder.

       This decoder decodes rawvideo streams.

       Options

       top top_field_first
           Specify the assumed field type of the input video.

           -1  the video is assumed to be progressive (default)

           0   bottom-field-first is assumed

           1   top-field-first is assumed

* AUDIO DECODERS
   ffwavesynth
       Internal wave synthetizer.

       This decoder generates wave patterns according to predefined sequences.
       Its use is purely internal and the format of the data it accepts is not
       publicly documented.

* ENCODERS
       Encoders are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow the encoding of
       multimedia streams.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported native encoders
       are enabled by default. Encoders requiring an external library must be
       enabled manually via the corresponding "--enable-lib" option. You can
       list all available encoders using the configure option
       "--list-encoders".

       You can disable all the encoders with the configure option
       "--disable-encoders" and selectively enable / disable single encoders
       with the options "--enable-encoder=ENCODER" /
       "--disable-encoder=ENCODER".

       The option "-codecs" of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       encoders.

* AUDIO ENCODERS
       A description of some of the currently available audio encoders
       follows.

**   ac3 and ac3_fixed
       AC-3 audio encoders.

       These encoders implement part of ATSC A/52:2010 and ETSI TS 102 366, as
       well as the undocumented RealAudio 3 (a.k.a. dnet).

       The ac3 encoder uses floating-point math, while the ac3_fixed encoder
       only uses fixed-point integer math. This does not mean that one is
       always faster, just that one or the other may be better suited to a
       particular system. The floating-point encoder will generally produce
       better quality audio for a given bitrate. The ac3_fixed encoder is not
       the default codec for any of the output formats, so it must be
       specified explicitly using the option "-acodec ac3_fixed" in order to
       use it.

       AC-3 Metadata

       The AC-3 metadata options are used to set parameters that describe the
       audio, but in most cases do not affect the audio encoding itself. Some
       of the options do directly affect or influence the decoding and
       playback of the resulting bitstream, while others are just for
       informational purposes. A few of the options will add bits to the
       output stream that could otherwise be used for audio data, and will
       thus affect the quality of the output. Those will be indicated
       accordingly with a note in the option list below.

       These parameters are described in detail in several publicly-available
       documents.

***       Metadata Control Options

       -per_frame_metadata boolean
           Allow Per-Frame Metadata. Specifies if the encoder should check for
           changing metadata for each frame.

           0   The metadata values set at initialization will be used for
               every frame in the stream. (default)

           1   Metadata values can be changed before encoding each frame.

       Downmix Levels

       -center_mixlev level
           Center Mix Level. The amount of gain the decoder should apply to
           the center channel when downmixing to stereo. This field will only
           be written to the bitstream if a center channel is present. The
           value is specified as a scale factor. There are 3 valid values:

           0.707
               Apply -3dB gain

           0.595
               Apply -4.5dB gain (default)

           0.500
               Apply -6dB gain

       -surround_mixlev level
           Surround Mix Level. The amount of gain the decoder should apply to
           the surround channel(s) when downmixing to stereo. This field will
           only be written to the bitstream if one or more surround channels
           are present. The value is specified as a scale factor.  There are 3
           valid values:

           0.707
               Apply -3dB gain

           0.500
               Apply -6dB gain (default)

           0.000
               Silence Surround Channel(s)

***       Audio Production Information

       Audio Production Information is optional information describing the
       mixing environment.  Either none or both of the fields are written to
       the bitstream.

       -mixing_level number
           Mixing Level. Specifies peak sound pressure level (SPL) in the
           production environment when the mix was mastered. Valid values are
           80 to 111, or -1 for unknown or not indicated. The default value is
           -1, but that value cannot be used if the Audio Production
           Information is written to the bitstream. Therefore, if the
           "room_type" option is not the default value, the "mixing_level"
           option must not be -1.

       -room_type type
           Room Type. Describes the equalization used during the final mixing
           session at the studio or on the dubbing stage. A large room is a
           dubbing stage with the industry standard X-curve equalization; a
           small room has flat equalization.  This field will not be written
           to the bitstream if both the "mixing_level" option and the
           "room_type" option have the default values.

           0
           notindicated
               Not Indicated (default)

           1
           large
               Large Room

           2
           small
               Small Room

***       Other Metadata Options

       -copyright boolean
           Copyright Indicator. Specifies whether a copyright exists for this
           audio.

           0
           off No Copyright Exists (default)

           1
           on  Copyright Exists

       -dialnorm value
           Dialogue Normalization. Indicates how far the average dialogue
           level of the program is below digital 100% full scale (0 dBFS).
           This parameter determines a level shift during audio reproduction
           that sets the average volume of the dialogue to a preset level. The
           goal is to match volume level between program sources. A value of
           -31dB will result in no volume level change, relative to the source
           volume, during audio reproduction. Valid values are whole numbers
           in the range -31 to -1, with -31 being the default.

       -dsur_mode mode
           Dolby Surround Mode. Specifies whether the stereo signal uses Dolby
           Surround (Pro Logic). This field will only be written to the
           bitstream if the audio stream is stereo. Using this option does NOT
           mean the encoder will actually apply Dolby Surround processing.

           0
           notindicated
               Not Indicated (default)

           1
           off Not Dolby Surround Encoded

           2
           on  Dolby Surround Encoded

       -original boolean
           Original Bit Stream Indicator. Specifies whether this audio is from
           the original source and not a copy.

           0
           off Not Original Source

           1
           on  Original Source (default)

***       Extended Bitstream Information

       The extended bitstream options are part of the Alternate Bit Stream
       Syntax as specified in Annex D of the A/52:2010 standard. It is grouped
       into 2 parts.  If any one parameter in a group is specified, all values
       in that group will be written to the bitstream.  Default values are
       used for those that are written but have not been specified.  If the
       mixing levels are written, the decoder will use these values instead of

***       Other AC-3 Encoding Options

       -stereo_rematrixing boolean
           Stereo Rematrixing. Enables/Disables use of rematrixing for stereo
           input. This is an optional AC-3 feature that increases quality by
           selectively encoding the left/right channels as mid/side. This
           option is enabled by default, and it is highly recommended that it
           be left as enabled except for testing purposes.

       Floating-Point-Only AC-3 Encoding Options

       These options are only valid for the floating-point encoder and do not
       exist for the fixed-point encoder due to the corresponding features not
       being implemented in fixed-point.

       -channel_coupling boolean
           Enables/Disables use of channel coupling, which is an optional AC-3
           feature that increases quality by combining high frequency
           information from multiple channels into a single channel. The per-
           channel high frequency information is sent with less accuracy in
           both the frequency and time domains. This allows more bits to be
           used for lower frequencies while preserving enough information to
           reconstruct the high frequencies. This option is enabled by default
           for the floating-point encoder and should generally be left as
           enabled except for testing purposes or to increase encoding speed.

       -cpl_start_band number
           Coupling Start Band. Sets the channel coupling start band, from 1
           to 15. If a value higher than the bandwidth is used, it will be
           reduced to 1 less than the coupling end band. If auto is used, the
           start band will be determined by the encoder based on the bit rate,
           sample rate, and channel layout. This option has no effect if
           channel coupling is disabled.

* VIDEO ENCODERS
       A description of some of the currently available video encoders
       follows.

**   libtheora
       Theora format supported through libtheora.

       Requires the presence of the libtheora headers and library during
       configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
       "--enable-libtheora".

       Options

       The following global options are mapped to internal libtheora options
       which affect the quality and the bitrate of the encoded stream.

       b   Set the video bitrate, only works if the "qscale" flag in flags is
           not enabled.

       flags
           Used to enable constant quality mode encoding through the qscale
           flag, and to enable the "pass1" and "pass2" modes.

       g   Set the GOP size.

       global_quality
           Set the global quality in lambda units, only works if the "qscale"
           flag in flags is enabled. The value is clipped in the [0 -
           10*"FF_QP2LAMBDA"] range, and then multiplied for 6.3 to get a
           value in the native libtheora range [0-63].

           For example, to set maximum constant quality encoding with ffmpeg:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -flags:v qscale -global_quality:v "10*QP2LAMBDA" -codec:v libtheora OUTPUT.ogg

**   libvpx
       VP8 format supported through libvpx.

       Requires the presence of the libvpx headers and library during
       configuration.  You need to explicitly configure the build with
       "--enable-libvpx".

**   libx264
       H.264 / AVC / MPEG-4 AVC / MPEG-4 part 10 format supported through
       libx264.

       Requires the presence of the libx264 headers and library during
       configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
       "--enable-libx264".

       Options

* DEMUXERS
       Demuxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to read the
       multimedia streams from a particular type of file.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported demuxers are
       enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the configure
       option "--list-demuxers".

       You can disable all the demuxers using the configure option
       "--disable-demuxers", and selectively enable a single demuxer with the
       option "--enable-demuxer=DEMUXER", or disable it with the option
       "--disable-demuxer=DEMUXER".

       The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       demuxers.

       The description of some of the currently available demuxers follows.

   image2
       Image file demuxer.

       This demuxer reads from a list of image files specified by a pattern.
       The syntax and meaning of the pattern is specified by the option
       pattern_type.

       The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
       determine the format of the images contained in the files.

       The size, the pixel format, and the format of each image must be the
       same for all the files in the sequence.

       This demuxer accepts the following options:

       framerate
           Set the framerate for the video stream. It defaults to 25.

       loop
           If set to 1, loop over the input. Default value is 0.

       pattern_type
           Select the pattern type used to interpret the provided filename.

           pattern_type accepts one of the following values.

           sequence
               Select a sequence pattern type, used to specify a sequence of
               files indexed by sequential numbers.

               A sequence pattern may contain the string "%d" or "%0Nd", which
               specifies the position of the characters representing a
               sequential number in each filename matched by the pattern. If
               the form "%d0Nd" is used, the string representing the number in
               each filename is 0-padded and N is the total number of 0-padded
               digits representing the number. The literal character '%' can
               be specified in the pattern with the string "%%".

               If the sequence pattern contains "%d" or "%0Nd", the first
               filename of the file list specified by the pattern must contain
               a number inclusively contained between start_number and
               start_number+start_number_range-1, and all the following
               numbers must be sequential.

               For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will match a sequence of
               filenames of the form img-001.bmp, img-002.bmp, ...,
               img-010.bmp, etc.; the pattern "i%%m%%g-%d.jpg" will match a
               sequence of filenames of the form i%m%g-1.jpg, i%m%g-2.jpg,
               ..., i%m%g-10.jpg, etc.

               Note that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or
               "%0Nd", for example to convert a single image file img.jpeg you
               can employ the command:

                       ffmpeg -i img.jpeg img.png

           glob
               Select a glob wildcard pattern type.

               The pattern is interpreted like a "glob()" pattern. This is
               only selectable if libavformat was compiled with globbing
               support.

           glob_sequence (deprecated, will be removed)
               Select a mixed glob wildcard/sequence pattern.

               If your version of libavformat was compiled with globbing
               support, and the provided pattern contains at least one glob
               meta character among "%*?[]{}" that is preceded by an unescaped
               "%", the pattern is interpreted like a "glob()" pattern,
               otherwise it is interpreted like a sequence pattern.

               All glob special characters "%*?[]{}" must be prefixed with
               "%". To escape a literal "%" you shall use "%%".

               For example the pattern "foo-%*.jpeg" will match all the
               filenames prefixed by "foo-" and terminating with ".jpeg", and
               "foo-%?%?%?.jpeg" will match all the filenames prefixed with
               "foo-", followed by a sequence of three characters, and
               terminating with ".jpeg".

               This pattern type is deprecated in favor of glob and sequence.

           Default value is glob_sequence.

       pixel_format
           Set the pixel format of the images to read. If not specified the
           pixel format is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

       start_number
           Set the index of the file matched by the image file pattern to
           start to read from. Default value is 0.

       start_number_range
           Set the index interval range to check when looking for the first
           image file in the sequence, starting from start_number. Default
           value is 5.

       video_size
           Set the video size of the images to read. If not specified the
           video size is guessed from the first image file in the sequence.

       Examples

       o   Use ffmpeg for creating a video from the images in the file
           sequence img-001.jpeg, img-002.jpeg, ..., assuming an input frame
           rate of 10 frames per second:

                   ffmpeg -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' -r 10 out.mkv

       o   As above, but start by reading from a file with index 100 in the
           sequence:

                   ffmpeg -start_number 100 -i 'img-%03d.jpeg' -r 10 out.mkv

       o   Read images matching the "*.png" glob pattern , that is all the
           files terminating with the ".png" suffix:

                   ffmpeg -pattern_type glob -i "*.png" -r 10 out.mkv

   applehttp
       Apple HTTP Live Streaming demuxer.

       This demuxer presents all AVStreams from all variant streams.  The id
       field is set to the bitrate variant index number. By setting the
       discard flags on AVStreams (by pressing 'a' or 'v' in ffplay), the
       caller can decide which variant streams to actually receive.  The total
       bitrate of the variant that the stream belongs to is available in a
       metadata key named "variant_bitrate".

   sbg
       SBaGen script demuxer.

       This demuxer reads the script language used by SBaGen
       <http://uazu.net/sbagen/> to generate binaural beats sessions. A SBG
       script looks like that:

               NOW      == a
               +0:07:00 == b
               +0:14:00 == a
               +0:21:00 == b
               +0:30:00    off

       A SBG script can mix absolute and relative timestamps. If the script
       uses either only absolute timestamps (including the script start time)
       or only relative ones, then its layout is fixed, and the conversion is
       straightforward. On the other hand, if the script mixes both kind of
       timestamps, then the NOW reference for relative timestamps will be
       taken from the current time of day at the time the script is read, and
       the script layout will be frozen according to that reference. That
       means that if the script is directly played, the actual times will
       match the absolute timestamps up to the sound controller's clock
       accuracy, but if the user somehow pauses the playback or seeks, all
       times will be shifted accordingly.

* MUXERS
       Muxers are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow writing multimedia
       streams to a particular type of file.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported muxers are
       enabled by default. You can list all available muxers using the
       configure option "--list-muxers".

       You can disable all the muxers with the configure option
       "--disable-muxers" and selectively enable / disable single muxers with
       the options "--enable-muxer=MUXER" / "--disable-muxer=MUXER".

       The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       muxers.

       A description of some of the currently available muxers follows.

   crc
       CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC of all the input audio
       and video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed
       16-bit raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the
       CRC.

       The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form:
       CRC=0xCRC, where CRC is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits
       containing the CRC for all the decoded input frames.

       For example to compute the CRC of the input, and store it in the file
       out.crc:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc out.crc

       You can print the CRC to stdout with the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f crc -

       You can select the output format of each frame with ffmpeg by
       specifying the audio and video codec and format. For example to compute
       the CRC of the input audio converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit and the
       input video converted to MPEG-2 video, use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f crc -

       See also the framecrc muxer.

   framecrc
       Per-packet CRC (Cyclic Redundancy Check) testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the Adler-32 CRC for each audio and
       video packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit
       raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the CRC.

       The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
       packet of the form:

               <stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, 0x<CRC>

       CRC is a hexadecimal number 0-padded to 8 digits containing the CRC of
       the packet.

       For example to compute the CRC of the audio and video frames in INPUT,
       converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
       out.crc:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc out.crc

       To print the information to stdout, use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framecrc -

       With ffmpeg, you can select the output format to which the audio and
       video frames are encoded before computing the CRC for each packet by
       specifying the audio and video codec. For example, to compute the CRC
       of each decoded input audio frame converted to PCM unsigned 8-bit and
       of each decoded input video frame converted to MPEG-2 video, use the
       command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -c:a pcm_u8 -c:v mpeg2video -f framecrc -

       See also the crc muxer.

   framemd5
       Per-packet MD5 testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash for each audio and video
       packet. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit raw
       audio and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.

       The output of the muxer consists of a line for each audio and video
       packet of the form:

               <stream_index>, <packet_dts>, <packet_pts>, <packet_duration>, <packet_size>, <MD5>

       MD5 is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash for the
       packet.

       For example to compute the MD5 of the audio and video frames in INPUT,
       converted to raw audio and video packets, and store it in the file
       out.md5:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 out.md5

       To print the information to stdout, use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f framemd5 -

       See also the md5 muxer.

   hls
       Apple HTTP Live Streaming muxer that segments MPEG-TS according to the
       HTTP Live Streaming specification.

       It creates a playlist file and numbered segment files. The output
       filename specifies the playlist filename; the segment filenames receive
       the same basename as the playlist, a sequential number and a .ts
       extension.

               ffmpeg -i in.nut out.m3u8

       -hls_time segment length in seconds
       -hls_list_size maximum number of playlist entries
       -hls_wrap number after which index wraps

   ico
       ICO file muxer.

       Microsoft's icon file format (ICO) has some strict limitations that
       should be noted:

       o   Size cannot exceed 256 pixels in any dimension

       o   Only BMP and PNG images can be stored

       o   If a BMP image is used, it must be one of the following pixel
           formats:

                   BMP Bit Depth      FFmpeg Pixel Format
                   1bit               pal8
                   4bit               pal8
                   8bit               pal8
                   16bit              rgb555le
                   24bit              bgr24
                   32bit              bgra

       o   If a BMP image is used, it must use the BITMAPINFOHEADER DIB header

       o   If a PNG image is used, it must use the rgba pixel format

   image2
       Image file muxer.

       The image file muxer writes video frames to image files.

       The output filenames are specified by a pattern, which can be used to
       produce sequentially numbered series of files.  The pattern may contain
       the string "%d" or "%0Nd", this string specifies the position of the
       characters representing a numbering in the filenames. If the form
       "%0Nd" is used, the string representing the number in each filename is
       0-padded to N digits. The literal character '%' can be specified in the
       pattern with the string "%%".

       If the pattern contains "%d" or "%0Nd", the first filename of the file
       list specified will contain the number 1, all the following numbers
       will be sequential.

       The pattern may contain a suffix which is used to automatically
       determine the format of the image files to write.

       For example the pattern "img-%03d.bmp" will specify a sequence of
       filenames of the form img-001.bmp, img-002.bmp, ..., img-010.bmp, etc.
       The pattern "img%%-%d.jpg" will specify a sequence of filenames of the
       form img%-1.jpg, img%-2.jpg, ..., img%-10.jpg, etc.

       The following example shows how to use ffmpeg for creating a sequence
       of files img-001.jpeg, img-002.jpeg, ..., taking one image every second
       from the input video:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 -f image2 'img-%03d.jpeg'

       Note that with ffmpeg, if the format is not specified with the "-f"
       option and the output filename specifies an image file format, the
       image2 muxer is automatically selected, so the previous command can be
       written as:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vsync 1 -r 1 'img-%03d.jpeg'

       Note also that the pattern must not necessarily contain "%d" or "%0Nd",
       for example to create a single image file img.jpeg from the input video
       you can employ the command:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -f image2 -frames:v 1 img.jpeg

       The image muxer supports the .Y.U.V image file format. This format is
       special in that that each image frame consists of three files, for each
       of the YUV420P components. To read or write this image file format,
       specify the name of the '.Y' file. The muxer will automatically open
       the '.U' and '.V' files as required.

   md5
       MD5 testing format.

       This muxer computes and prints the MD5 hash of all the input audio and
       video frames. By default audio frames are converted to signed 16-bit
       raw audio and video frames to raw video before computing the hash.

       The output of the muxer consists of a single line of the form: MD5=MD5,
       where MD5 is a hexadecimal number representing the computed MD5 hash.

       For example to compute the MD5 hash of the input converted to raw audio
       and video, and store it in the file out.md5:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 out.md5

       You can print the MD5 to stdout with the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -f md5 -

       See also the framemd5 muxer.

   MOV/MP4/ISMV
       The mov/mp4/ismv muxer supports fragmentation. Normally, a MOV/MP4 file
       has all the metadata about all packets stored in one location (written
       at the end of the file, it can be moved to the start for better
       playback by adding faststart to the movflags, or using the qt-faststart
       tool). A fragmented file consists of a number of fragments, where
       packets and metadata about these packets are stored together. Writing a
       fragmented file has the advantage that the file is decodable even if
       the writing is interrupted (while a normal MOV/MP4 is undecodable if it
       is not properly finished), and it requires less memory when writing
       very long files (since writing normal MOV/MP4 files stores info about
       every single packet in memory until the file is closed). The downside
       is that it is less compatible with other applications.

       Fragmentation is enabled by setting one of the AVOptions that define
       how to cut the file into fragments:

       -moov_size bytes
           Reserves space for the moov atom at the beginning of the file
           instead of placing the moov atom at the end. If the space reserved
           is insufficient, muxing will fail.

       -movflags frag_keyframe
           Start a new fragment at each video keyframe.

       -frag_duration duration
           Create fragments that are duration microseconds long.

       -frag_size size
           Create fragments that contain up to size bytes of payload data.

       -movflags frag_custom
           Allow the caller to manually choose when to cut fragments, by
           calling "av_write_frame(ctx, NULL)" to write a fragment with the
           packets written so far. (This is only useful with other
           applications integrating libavformat, not from ffmpeg.)

       -min_frag_duration duration
           Don't create fragments that are shorter than duration microseconds
           long.

       If more than one condition is specified, fragments are cut when one of
       the specified conditions is fulfilled. The exception to this is
       "-min_frag_duration", which has to be fulfilled for any of the other
       conditions to apply.

       Additionally, the way the output file is written can be adjusted
       through a few other options:

       -movflags empty_moov
           Write an initial moov atom directly at the start of the file,
           without describing any samples in it. Generally, an mdat/moov pair
           is written at the start of the file, as a normal MOV/MP4 file,
           containing only a short portion of the file. With this option set,
           there is no initial mdat atom, and the moov atom only describes the
           tracks but has a zero duration.

           Files written with this option set do not work in QuickTime.  This
           option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming)
           files.

       -movflags separate_moof
           Write a separate moof (movie fragment) atom for each track.
           Normally, packets for all tracks are written in a moof atom (which
           is slightly more efficient), but with this option set, the muxer
           writes one moof/mdat pair for each track, making it easier to
           separate tracks.

           This option is implicitly set when writing ismv (Smooth Streaming)
           files.

       -movflags faststart
           Run a second pass moving the moov atom on top of the file. This
           operation can take a while, and will not work in various situations
           such as fragmented output, thus it is not enabled by default.

       Smooth Streaming content can be pushed in real time to a publishing
       point on IIS with this muxer. Example:

               ffmpeg -re <<normal input/transcoding options>> -movflags isml+frag_keyframe -f ismv http://server/publishingpoint.isml/Streams(Encoder1)

   mpegts
       MPEG transport stream muxer.

       This muxer implements ISO 13818-1 and part of ETSI EN 300 468.

       The muxer options are:

       -mpegts_original_network_id number
           Set the original_network_id (default 0x0001). This is unique
           identifier of a network in DVB. Its main use is in the unique
           identification of a service through the path Original_Network_ID,
           Transport_Stream_ID.

       -mpegts_transport_stream_id number
           Set the transport_stream_id (default 0x0001). This identifies a
           transponder in DVB.

       -mpegts_service_id number
           Set the service_id (default 0x0001) also known as program in DVB.

       -mpegts_pmt_start_pid number
           Set the first PID for PMT (default 0x1000, max 0x1f00).

       -mpegts_start_pid number
           Set the first PID for data packets (default 0x0100, max 0x0f00).

       The recognized metadata settings in mpegts muxer are "service_provider"
       and "service_name". If they are not set the default for
       "service_provider" is "FFmpeg" and the default for "service_name" is
       "Service01".

               ffmpeg -i file.mpg -c copy \
                    -mpegts_original_network_id 0x1122 \
                    -mpegts_transport_stream_id 0x3344 \
                    -mpegts_service_id 0x5566 \
                    -mpegts_pmt_start_pid 0x1500 \
                    -mpegts_start_pid 0x150 \
                    -metadata service_provider="Some provider" \
                    -metadata service_name="Some Channel" \
                    -y out.ts

   null
       Null muxer.

       This muxer does not generate any output file, it is mainly useful for
       testing or benchmarking purposes.

       For example to benchmark decoding with ffmpeg you can use the command:

               ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null out.null

       Note that the above command does not read or write the out.null file,
       but specifying the output file is required by the ffmpeg syntax.

       Alternatively you can write the command as:

               ffmpeg -benchmark -i INPUT -f null -

   matroska
       Matroska container muxer.

       This muxer implements the matroska and webm container specs.

       The recognized metadata settings in this muxer are:

       title=title name

       line:

               ffmpeg -i sample_left_right_clip.mpg -an -c:v libvpx -metadata stereo_mode=left_right -y stereo_clip.webm

   segment, stream_segment, ssegment
       Basic stream segmenter.

       The segmenter muxer outputs streams to a number of separate files of
       nearly fixed duration. Output filename pattern can be set in a fashion
       similar to image2.

       "stream_segment" is a variant of the muxer used to write to streaming
       output formats, i.e. which do not require global headers, and is
       recommended for outputting e.g. to MPEG transport stream segments.
       "ssegment" is a shorter alias for "stream_segment".

       Every segment starts with a video keyframe, if a video stream is
       present.  Note that if you want accurate splitting for a video file,
       you need to make the input key frames correspond to the exact splitting
       times expected by the segmenter, or the segment muxer will start the
       new segment with the key frame found next after the specified start
       time.

       The segment muxer works best with a single constant frame rate video.

       Optionally it can generate a list of the created segments, by setting
       the option segment_list. The list type is specified by the
       segment_list_type option.

       The segment muxer supports the following options:

       segment_format format
           Override the inner container format, by default it is guessed by
           the filename extension.

       segment_list name
           Generate also a listfile named name. If not specified no listfile
           is generated.

       segment_list_flags flags
           Set flags affecting the segment list generation.

           It currently supports the following flags:

           cache
               Allow caching (only affects M3U8 list files).

           live
               Allow live-friendly file generation.

               This currently only affects M3U8 lists. In particular, write a
               fake EXT-X-TARGETDURATION duration field at the top of the
               file, based on the specified segment_time.

           Default value is "cache".

       segment_list_size size
           Overwrite the listfile once it reaches size entries. If 0 the
           listfile is never overwritten. Default value is 0.

       segment_list type type
           Specify the format for the segment list file.

           The following values are recognized:

           flat
               Generate a flat list for the created segments, one segment per
               line.

           csv, ext
               Generate a list for the created segments, one segment per line,
               each line matching the format (comma-separated values):

                       <segment_filename>,<segment_start_time>,<segment_end_time>

               segment_filename is the name of the output file generated by
               the muxer according to the provided pattern. CSV escaping
               (according to RFC4180) is applied if required.

               segment_start_time and segment_end_time specify the segment
               start and end time expressed in seconds.

               A list file with the suffix ".csv" or ".ext" will auto-select
               this format.

               "ext" is deprecated in favor or "csv".

           m3u8
               Generate an extended M3U8 file, version 4, compliant with
               <http://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-pantos-http-live-streaming-08.txt>.

               A list file with the suffix ".m3u8" will auto-select this
               format.

           If not specified the type is guessed from the list file name
           suffix.

       segment_time time
           Set segment duration to time. Default value is "2".

       segment_time_delta delta
           Specify the accuracy time when selecting the start time for a
           segment. Default value is "0".

           When delta is specified a key-frame will start a new segment if its
           PTS satisfies the relation:

                   PTS >= start_time - time_delta

           This option is useful when splitting video content, which is always
           split at GOP boundaries, in case a key frame is found just before
           the specified split time.

           In particular may be used in combination with the ffmpeg option
           force_key_frames. The key frame times specified by force_key_frames
           may not be set accurately because of rounding issues, with the
           consequence that a key frame time may result set just before the
           specified time. For constant frame rate videos a value of
           1/2*frame_rate should address the worst case mismatch between the
           specified time and the time set by force_key_frames.

       segment_times times
           Specify a list of split points. times contains a list of comma
           separated duration specifications, in increasing order.

       segment_wrap limit
           Wrap around segment index once it reaches limit.

       Some examples follow.

       o   To remux the content of file in.mkv to a list of segments
           out-000.nut, out-001.nut, etc., and write the list of generated
           segments to out.list:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -codec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_list out.list out%03d.nut

       o   As the example above, but segment the input file according to the
           split points specified by the segment_times option:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -codec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_list out.csv -segment_times 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 out%03d.nut

       o   As the example above, but use the "ffmpeg" force_key_frames option
           to force key frames in the input at the specified location,
           together with the segment option segment_time_delta to account for
           possible roundings operated when setting key frame times.

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -force_key_frames 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 -vcodec mpeg4 -acodec pcm_s16le -map 0 \
                   -f segment -segment_list out.csv -segment_times 1,2,3,5,8,13,21 -segment_time_delta 0.05 out%03d.nut

           In order to force key frames on the input file, transcoding is
           required.

       o   To convert the in.mkv to TS segments using the "libx264" and
           "libfaac" encoders:

                   ffmpeg -i in.mkv -map 0 -codec:v libx264 -codec:a libfaac -f ssegment -segment_list out.list out%03d.ts

       o   Segment the input file, and create an M3U8 live playlist (can be
           used as live HLS source):

                   ffmpeg -re -i in.mkv -codec copy -map 0 -f segment -segment_list playlist.m3u8 \
                   -segment_list_flags +live -segment_time 10 out%03d.mkv

   mp3
       The MP3 muxer writes a raw MP3 stream with an ID3v2 header at the
       beginning and optionally an ID3v1 tag at the end. ID3v2.3 and ID3v2.4
       are supported, the "id3v2_version" option controls which one is used.
       The legacy ID3v1 tag is not written by default, but may be enabled with
       the "write_id3v1" option.

       For seekable output the muxer also writes a Xing frame at the
       beginning, which contains the number of frames in the file. It is
       useful for computing duration of VBR files.

       The muxer supports writing ID3v2 attached pictures (APIC frames). The
       pictures are supplied to the muxer in form of a video stream with a
       single packet. There can be any number of those streams, each will
       correspond to a single APIC frame.  The stream metadata tags title and
       comment map to APIC description and picture type respectively. See
       <http://id3.org/id3v2.4.0-frames> for allowed picture types.

       Note that the APIC frames must be written at the beginning, so the
       muxer will buffer the audio frames until it gets all the pictures. It
       is therefore advised to provide the pictures as soon as possible to
       avoid excessive buffering.

       Examples:

       Write an mp3 with an ID3v2.3 header and an ID3v1 footer:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -id3v2_version 3 -write_id3v1 1 out.mp3

       Attach a picture to an mp3:

               ffmpeg -i input.mp3 -i cover.png -c copy -metadata:s:v title="Album cover"
               -metadata:s:v comment="Cover (Front)" out.mp3

* INPUT DEVICES
       Input devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access
       the data coming from a multimedia device attached to your system.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported input devices
       are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
       configure option "--list-indevs".

       You can disable all the input devices using the configure option
       "--disable-indevs", and selectively enable an input device using the
       option "--enable-indev=INDEV", or you can disable a particular input
       device using the option "--disable-indev=INDEV".

       The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of
       supported input devices (amongst the demuxers).

       A description of the currently available input devices follows.

***   alsa
       ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libasound
       installed on your system.

       This device allows capturing from an ALSA device. The name of the
       device to capture has to be an ALSA card identifier.

       An ALSA identifier has the syntax:

               hw:<CARD>[,<DEV>[,<SUBDEV>]]

       where the DEV and SUBDEV components are optional.

       The three arguments (in order: CARD,DEV,SUBDEV) specify card number or
       identifier, device number and subdevice number (-1 means any).

       To see the list of cards currently recognized by your system check the
       files /proc/asound/cards and /proc/asound/devices.

       For example to capture with ffmpeg from an ALSA device with card id 0,
       you may run the command:

               ffmpeg -f alsa -i hw:0 alsaout.wav

       For more information see:
       <http://www.alsa-project.org/alsa-doc/alsa-lib/pcm.html>

   bktr
       BSD video input device.

***   dshow
       Windows DirectShow input device.

       DirectShow support is enabled when FFmpeg is built with the mingw-w64
       project.  Currently only audio and video devices are supported.

       Multiple devices may be opened as separate inputs, but they may also be
       opened on the same input, which should improve synchronism between
       them.

       The input name should be in the format:

               <TYPE>=<NAME>[:<TYPE>=<NAME>]

       where TYPE can be either audio or video, and NAME is the device's name.

       Options

       If no options are specified, the device's defaults are used.  If the
       device does not support the requested options, it will fail to open.

       video_size
           Set the video size in the captured video.

       framerate
           Set the framerate in the captured video.

       sample_rate
           Set the sample rate (in Hz) of the captured audio.

       sample_size
           Set the sample size (in bits) of the captured audio.

       channels
           Set the number of channels in the captured audio.

       list_devices
           If set to true, print a list of devices and exit.

       list_options
           If set to true, print a list of selected device's options and exit.

       video_device_number
           Set video device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
           defaults to 0).

       audio_device_number
           Set audio device number for devices with same name (starts at 0,
           defaults to 0).

       pixel_format
           Select pixel format to be used by DirectShow. This may only be set
           when the video codec is not set or set to rawvideo.

       audio_buffer_size
           Set audio device buffer size in milliseconds (which can directly
           impact latency, depending on the device).  Defaults to using the
           audio device's default buffer size (typically some multiple of
           500ms).  Setting this value too low can degrade performance.  See
           also
           <http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd377582(v=vs.85).aspx>

       Examples

       o   Print the list of DirectShow supported devices and exit:

                   $ ffmpeg -list_devices true -f dshow -i dummy

       o   Open video device Camera:

                   $ ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Camera"

       o   Open second video device with name Camera:

                   $ ffmpeg -f dshow -video_device_number 1 -i video="Camera"

       o   Open video device Camera and audio device Microphone:

                   $ ffmpeg -f dshow -i video="Camera":audio="Microphone"

       o   Print the list of supported options in selected device and exit:

                   $ ffmpeg -list_options true -f dshow -i video="Camera"

   dv1394
       Linux DV 1394 input device.

***   fbdev
       Linux framebuffer input device.

       The Linux framebuffer is a graphic hardware-independent abstraction
       layer to show graphics on a computer monitor, typically on the console.
       It is accessed through a file device node, usually /dev/fb0.

       For more detailed information read the file
       Documentation/fb/framebuffer.txt included in the Linux source tree.

       To record from the framebuffer device /dev/fb0 with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -f fbdev -r 10 -i /dev/fb0 out.avi

       You can take a single screenshot image with the command:

               ffmpeg -f fbdev -frames:v 1 -r 1 -i /dev/fb0 screenshot.jpeg

       See also <http://linux-fbdev.sourceforge.net/>, and fbset(1).

***   iec61883
       FireWire DV/HDV input device using libiec61883.

       To enable this input device, you need libiec61883, libraw1394 and
       libavc1394 installed on your system. Use the configure option
       "--enable-libiec61883" to compile with the device enabled.

       The iec61883 capture device supports capturing from a video device
       connected via IEEE1394 (FireWire), using libiec61883 and the new Linux
       FireWire stack (juju). This is the default DV/HDV input method in Linux
       Kernel 2.6.37 and later, since the old FireWire stack was removed.

       Specify the FireWire port to be used as input file, or "auto" to choose
       the first port connected.

       Options

       dvtype
           Override autodetection of DV/HDV. This should only be used if auto
           detection does not work, or if usage of a different device type
           should be prohibited. Treating a DV device as HDV (or vice versa)
           will not work and result in undefined behavior.  The values auto,
           dv and hdv are supported.

       dvbuffer
           Set maxiumum size of buffer for incoming data, in frames. For DV,
           this is an exact value. For HDV, it is not frame exact, since HDV
           does not have a fixed frame size.

       dvguid
           Select the capture device by specifying it's GUID. Capturing will
           only be performed from the specified device and fails if no device
           with the given GUID is found. This is useful to select the input if
           multiple devices are connected at the same time.  Look at
           /sys/bus/firewire/devices to find out the GUIDs.

       Examples

       o   Grab and show the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device.

                   ffplay -f iec61883 -i auto

       o   Grab and record the input of a FireWire DV/HDV device, using a
           packet buffer of 100000 packets if the source is HDV.

                   ffmpeg -f iec61883 -i auto -hdvbuffer 100000 out.mpg

***   jack
       JACK input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libjack
       installed on your system.

       A JACK input device creates one or more JACK writable clients, one for
       each audio channel, with name client_name:input_N, where client_name is
       the name provided by the application, and N is a number which
       identifies the channel.  Each writable client will send the acquired
       data to the FFmpeg input device.

       Once you have created one or more JACK readable clients, you need to
       connect them to one or more JACK writable clients.

       To connect or disconnect JACK clients you can use the jack_connect and
       jack_disconnect programs, or do it through a graphical interface, for
       example with qjackctl.

       To list the JACK clients and their properties you can invoke the
       command jack_lsp.

       Follows an example which shows how to capture a JACK readable client
       with ffmpeg.

               # Create a JACK writable client with name "ffmpeg".
               $ ffmpeg -f jack -i ffmpeg -y out.wav

               # Start the sample jack_metro readable client.
               $ jack_metro -b 120 -d 0.2 -f 4000

               # List the current JACK clients.
               $ jack_lsp -c
               system:capture_1
               system:capture_2
               system:playback_1
               system:playback_2
               ffmpeg:input_1
               metro:120_bpm

               # Connect metro to the ffmpeg writable client.
               $ jack_connect metro:120_bpm ffmpeg:input_1

       For more information read: <http://jackaudio.org/>

***   lavfi
       Libavfilter input virtual device.

       This input device reads data from the open output pads of a libavfilter
       filtergraph.

       For each filtergraph open output, the input device will create a
       corresponding stream which is mapped to the generated output. Currently
       only video data is supported. The filtergraph is specified through the
       option graph.

       Options

       graph
           Specify the filtergraph to use as input. Each video open output
           must be labelled by a unique string of the form "outN", where N is
           a number starting from 0 corresponding to the mapped input stream
           generated by the device.  The first unlabelled output is
           automatically assigned to the "out0" label, but all the others need
           to be specified explicitly.

           If not specified defaults to the filename specified for the input
           device.

       graph_file
           Set the filename of the filtergraph to be read and sent to the
           other filters. Syntax of the filtergraph is the same as the one
           specified by the option graph.

       Examples

       o   Create a color video stream and play it back with ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -graph "color=pink [out0]" dummy

       o   As the previous example, but use filename for specifying the graph
           description, and omit the "out0" label:

                   ffplay -f lavfi color=pink

       o   Create three different video test filtered sources and play them:

                   ffplay -f lavfi -graph "testsrc [out0]; testsrc,hflip [out1]; testsrc,negate [out2]" test3

       o   Read an audio stream from a file using the amovie source and play
           it back with ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi "amovie=test.wav"

       o   Read an audio stream and a video stream and play it back with
           ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi "movie=test.avi[out0];amovie=test.wav[out1]"

***   libdc1394
       IIDC1394 input device, based on libdc1394 and libraw1394.

***   openal
       The OpenAL input device provides audio capture on all systems with a
       working OpenAL 1.1 implementation.

       To enable this input device during configuration, you need OpenAL
       headers and libraries installed on your system, and need to configure
       FFmpeg with "--enable-openal".

       OpenAL headers and libraries should be provided as part of your OpenAL
       implementation, or as an additional download (an SDK). Depending on
       your installation you may need to specify additional flags via the
       "--extra-cflags" and "--extra-ldflags" for allowing the build system to
       locate the OpenAL headers and libraries.

       An incomplete list of OpenAL implementations follows:

       Creative
           The official Windows implementation, providing hardware
           acceleration with supported devices and software fallback.  See
           <http://openal.org/>.

       OpenAL Soft
           Portable, open source (LGPL) software implementation. Includes
           backends for the most common sound APIs on the Windows, Linux,
           Solaris, and BSD operating systems.  See
           <http://kcat.strangesoft.net/openal.html>.

       Apple
           OpenAL is part of Core Audio, the official Mac OS X Audio
           interface.  See
           <http://developer.apple.com/technologies/mac/audio-and-video.html>

       This device allows to capture from an audio input device handled
       through OpenAL.

       You need to specify the name of the device to capture in the provided
       filename. If the empty string is provided, the device will
       automatically select the default device. You can get the list of the
       supported devices by using the option list_devices.

       Options

       channels
           Set the number of channels in the captured audio. Only the values 1
           (monaural) and 2 (stereo) are currently supported.  Defaults to 2.

       sample_size
           Set the sample size (in bits) of the captured audio. Only the
           values 8 and 16 are currently supported. Defaults to 16.

       sample_rate
           Set the sample rate (in Hz) of the captured audio.  Defaults to
           44.1k.

       list_devices
           If set to true, print a list of devices and exit.  Defaults to
           false.

       Examples

       Print the list of OpenAL supported devices and exit:

               $ ffmpeg -list_devices true -f openal -i dummy out.ogg

       Capture from the OpenAL device DR-BT101 via PulseAudio:

               $ ffmpeg -f openal -i 'DR-BT101 via PulseAudio' out.ogg

       Capture from the default device (note the empty string '' as filename):

               $ ffmpeg -f openal -i '' out.ogg

       Capture from two devices simultaneously, writing to two different
       files, within the same ffmpeg command:

               $ ffmpeg -f openal -i 'DR-BT101 via PulseAudio' out1.ogg -f openal -i 'ALSA Default' out2.ogg

       Note: not all OpenAL implementations support multiple simultaneous
       capture - try the latest OpenAL Soft if the above does not work.

***   oss
       Open Sound System input device.

       The filename to provide to the input device is the device node
       representing the OSS input device, and is usually set to /dev/dsp.

       For example to grab from /dev/dsp using ffmpeg use the command:

***   pulse
       pulseaudio input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libpulse-
       simple installed in your system.

       The filename to provide to the input device is a source device or the
       string "default"

       To list the pulse source devices and their properties you can invoke
       the command pactl list sources.

               ffmpeg -f pulse -i default /tmp/pulse.wav

       server AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -server <server name>

       Connects to a specific server.

       name AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -name <application name>

       Specify the application name pulse will use when showing active
       clients, by default it is the LIBAVFORMAT_IDENT string

       stream_name AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -stream_name <stream name>

       Specify the stream name pulse will use when showing active streams, by
       default it is "record"

       sample_rate AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -sample_rate <samplerate>

       Specify the samplerate in Hz, by default 48kHz is used.

       channels AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -channels <N>

       Specify the channels in use, by default 2 (stereo) is set.

       frame_size AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -frame_size <bytes>

       Specify the number of byte per frame, by default it is set to 1024.

       fragment_size AVOption

       The syntax is:

               -fragment_size <bytes>

       Specify the minimal buffering fragment in pulseaudio, it will affect
       the audio latency. By default it is unset.

***   sndio
       sndio input device.

       To enable this input device during configuration you need libsndio
       installed on your system.

       The filename to provide to the input device is the device node
       representing the sndio input device, and is usually set to /dev/audio0.

       For example to grab from /dev/audio0 using ffmpeg use the command:

               ffmpeg -f sndio -i /dev/audio0 /tmp/oss.wav

***   video4linux2
       Video4Linux2 input video device.

       The name of the device to grab is a file device node, usually Linux
       systems tend to automatically create such nodes when the device (e.g.
       an USB webcam) is plugged into the system, and has a name of the kind
       /dev/videoN, where N is a number associated to the device.

       Video4Linux2 devices usually support a limited set of widthxheight
       sizes and framerates. You can check which are supported using
       -list_formats all for Video4Linux2 devices.

       Some usage examples of the video4linux2 devices with ffmpeg and ffplay:

       The time base for the timestamps is 1 microsecond. Depending on the
       kernel version and configuration, the timestamps may be derived from
       the real time clock (origin at the Unix Epoch) or the monotonic clock
       (origin usually at boot time, unaffected by NTP or manual changes to
       the clock). The -timestamps abs or -ts abs option can be used to force
       conversion into the real time clock.

       Note that if FFmpeg is build with v4l-utils support ("--enable-libv4l2"
       option), it will always be used.

               # Grab and show the input of a video4linux2 device.
               ffplay -f video4linux2 -framerate 30 -video_size hd720 /dev/video0

               # Grab and record the input of a video4linux2 device, leave the
               framerate and size as previously set.
               ffmpeg -f video4linux2 -input_format mjpeg -i /dev/video0 out.mpeg

       "v4l" and "v4l2" can be used as aliases for the respective
       "video4linux" and "video4linux2".

***   vfwcap
       VfW (Video for Windows) capture input device.

       The filename passed as input is the capture driver number, ranging from
       0 to 9. You may use "list" as filename to print a list of drivers. Any
       other filename will be interpreted as device number 0.

***   x11grab
       X11 video input device.

       This device allows to capture a region of an X11 display.

       The filename passed as input has the syntax:

               [<hostname>]:<display_number>.<screen_number>[+<x_offset>,<y_offset>]

       hostname:display_number.screen_number specifies the X11 display name of
       the screen to grab from. hostname can be omitted, and defaults to
       "localhost". The environment variable DISPLAY contains the default
       display name.

       x_offset and y_offset specify the offsets of the grabbed area with
       respect to the top-left border of the X11 screen. They default to 0.

       Check the X11 documentation (e.g. man X) for more detailed information.

       Use the dpyinfo program for getting basic information about the
       properties of your X11 display (e.g. grep for "name" or "dimensions").

       For example to grab from :0.0 using ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       Grab at position "10,20":

               ffmpeg -f x11grab -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

**       Options

       draw_mouse
           Specify whether to draw the mouse pointer. A value of 0 specify not
           to draw the pointer. Default value is 1.

       follow_mouse
           Make the grabbed area follow the mouse. The argument can be
           "centered" or a number of pixels PIXELS.

           When it is specified with "centered", the grabbing region follows
           the mouse pointer and keeps the pointer at the center of region;
           otherwise, the region follows only when the mouse pointer reaches
           within PIXELS (greater than zero) to the edge of region.

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

           To follow only when the mouse pointer reaches within 100 pixels to
           edge:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse 100 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       framerate
           Set the grabbing frame rate. Default value is "ntsc", corresponding
           to a framerate of "30000/1001".

       show_region
           Show grabbed region on screen.

           If show_region is specified with 1, then the grabbing region will
           be indicated on screen. With this option, it is easy to know what
           is being grabbed if only a portion of the screen is grabbed.

           For example:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0+10,20 out.mpg

           With follow_mouse:

                   ffmpeg -f x11grab -follow_mouse centered -show_region 1 -r 25 -s cif -i :0.0 out.mpg

       video_size
           Set the video frame size. Default value is "vga".

* OUTPUT DEVICES
       Output devices are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to write
       multimedia data to an output device attached to your system.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported output devices
       are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the
       configure option "--list-outdevs".

       You can disable all the output devices using the configure option
       "--disable-outdevs", and selectively enable an output device using the
       option "--enable-outdev=OUTDEV", or you can disable a particular input
       device using the option "--disable-outdev=OUTDEV".

       The option "-formats" of the ff* tools will display the list of enabled
       output devices (amongst the muxers).

       A description of the currently available output devices follows.

   alsa
       ALSA (Advanced Linux Sound Architecture) output device.

   caca
       CACA output device.

       This output devices allows to show a video stream in CACA window.  Only
       one CACA window is allowed per application, so you can have only one
       instance of this output device in an application.

       To enable this output device you need to configure FFmpeg with
       "--enable-libcaca".  libcaca is a graphics library that outputs text
       instead of pixels.

       For more information about libcaca, check:
       <http://caca.zoy.org/wiki/libcaca>

       Options

       window_title
           Set the CACA window title, if not specified default to the filename
           specified for the output device.

       window_size
           Set the CACA window size, can be a string of the form widthxheight
           or a video size abbreviation.  If not specified it defaults to the
           size of the input video.

       driver
           Set display driver.

       algorithm
           Set dithering algorithm. Dithering is necessary because the picture
           being rendered has usually far more colours than the available
           palette.  The accepted values are listed with "-list_dither
           algorithms".

       antialias
           Set antialias method. Antialiasing smoothens the rendered image and
           avoids the commonly seen staircase effect.  The accepted values are
           listed with "-list_dither antialiases".

       charset
           Set which characters are going to be used when rendering text.  The
           accepted values are listed with "-list_dither charsets".

       color
           Set color to be used when rendering text.  The accepted values are
           listed with "-list_dither colors".

       list_drivers
           If set to true, print a list of available drivers and exit.

       list_dither
           List available dither options related to the argument.  The
           argument must be one of "algorithms", "antialiases", "charsets",
           "colors".

       Examples

       o   The following command shows the ffmpeg output is an CACA window,
           forcing its size to 80x25:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt rgb24 -window_size 80x25 -f caca -

       o   Show the list of available drivers and exit:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -pix_fmt rgb24 -f caca -list_drivers true -

       o   Show the list of available dither colors and exit:

                   ffmpeg -i INPUT -pix_fmt rgb24 -f caca -list_dither colors -

   oss
       OSS (Open Sound System) output device.

   sdl
       SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) output device.

       This output devices allows to show a video stream in an SDL window.
       Only one SDL window is allowed per application, so you can have only
       one instance of this output device in an application.

       To enable this output device you need libsdl installed on your system
       when configuring your build.

       For more information about SDL, check: <http://www.libsdl.org/>

       Options

       window_title
           Set the SDL window title, if not specified default to the filename
           specified for the output device.

       icon_title
           Set the name of the iconified SDL window, if not specified it is
           set to the same value of window_title.

       window_size
           Set the SDL window size, can be a string of the form widthxheight
           or a video size abbreviation.  If not specified it defaults to the
           size of the input video, downscaled according to the aspect ratio.

       Examples

       The following command shows the ffmpeg output is an SDL window, forcing
       its size to the qcif format:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -vcodec rawvideo -pix_fmt yuv420p -window_size qcif -f sdl "SDL output"

   sndio
       sndio audio output device.

* PROTOCOLS
       Protocols are configured elements in FFmpeg which allow to access
       resources which require the use of a particular protocol.

       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported protocols are
       enabled by default. You can list all available ones using the configure
       option "--list-protocols".

       You can disable all the protocols using the configure option
       "--disable-protocols", and selectively enable a protocol using the
       option "--enable-protocol=PROTOCOL", or you can disable a particular
       protocol using the option "--disable-protocol=PROTOCOL".

       The option "-protocols" of the ff* tools will display the list of
       supported protocols.

       A description of the currently available protocols follows.

   bluray
       Read BluRay playlist.

       The accepted options are:

       angle
           BluRay angle

       chapter
           Start chapter (1...N)

       playlist
           Playlist to read (BDMV/PLAYLIST/?????.mpls)

       Examples:

       Read longest playlist from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray:

               bluray:/mnt/bluray

       Read angle 2 of playlist 4 from BluRay mounted to /mnt/bluray, start
       from chapter 2:

               -playlist 4 -angle 2 -chapter 2 bluray:/mnt/bluray

   concat
       Physical concatenation protocol.

       Allow to read and seek from many resource in sequence as if they were a
       unique resource.

       A URL accepted by this protocol has the syntax:

               concat:<URL1>|<URL2>|...|<URLN>

       where URL1, URL2, ..., URLN are the urls of the resource to be
       concatenated, each one possibly specifying a distinct protocol.

       For example to read a sequence of files split1.mpeg, split2.mpeg,
       split3.mpeg with ffplay use the command:

               ffplay concat:split1.mpeg\|split2.mpeg\|split3.mpeg

       Note that you may need to escape the character "|" which is special for
       many shells.

   file
       File access protocol.

       Allow to read from or read to a file.

       For example to read from a file input.mpeg with ffmpeg use the command:

               ffmpeg -i file:input.mpeg output.mpeg

       The ff* tools default to the file protocol, that is a resource
       specified with the name "FILE.mpeg" is interpreted as the URL
       "file:FILE.mpeg".

   gopher
       Gopher protocol.

   hls
       Read Apple HTTP Live Streaming compliant segmented stream as a uniform
       one. The M3U8 playlists describing the segments can be remote HTTP
       resources or local files, accessed using the standard file protocol.
       The nested protocol is declared by specifying "+proto" after the hls
       URI scheme name, where proto is either "file" or "http".

               hls+http://host/path/to/remote/resource.m3u8
               hls+file://path/to/local/resource.m3u8

       Using this protocol is discouraged - the hls demuxer should work just
       as well (if not, please report the issues) and is more complete.  To
       use the hls demuxer instead, simply use the direct URLs to the m3u8
       files.

   http
       HTTP (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol).

   mmst
       MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over TCP.

   mmsh
       MMS (Microsoft Media Server) protocol over HTTP.

       The required syntax is:

               mmsh://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>]

   md5
       MD5 output protocol.

       Computes the MD5 hash of the data to be written, and on close writes
       this to the designated output or stdout if none is specified. It can be
       used to test muxers without writing an actual file.

       Some examples follow.

               # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to the file output.avi.md5.
               ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:output.avi.md5

               # Write the MD5 hash of the encoded AVI file to stdout.
               ffmpeg -i input.flv -f avi -y md5:

       Note that some formats (typically MOV) require the output protocol to
       be seekable, so they will fail with the MD5 output protocol.

   pipe
       UNIX pipe access protocol.

       Allow to read and write from UNIX pipes.

       The accepted syntax is:

               pipe:[<number>]

       number is the number corresponding to the file descriptor of the pipe
       (e.g. 0 for stdin, 1 for stdout, 2 for stderr).  If number is not
       specified, by default the stdout file descriptor will be used for
       writing, stdin for reading.

       For example to read from stdin with ffmpeg:

               cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:0
               # ...this is the same as...
               cat test.wav | ffmpeg -i pipe:

       For writing to stdout with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe:1 | cat > test.avi
               # ...this is the same as...
               ffmpeg -i test.wav -f avi pipe: | cat > test.avi

       Note that some formats (typically MOV), require the output protocol to
       be seekable, so they will fail with the pipe output protocol.

   rtmp
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMP) is used for streaming
       multimedia content across a TCP/IP network.

       The required syntax is:

               rtmp://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<instance>][/<playpath>]

       The accepted parameters are:

       server
           The address of the RTMP server.

       port
           The number of the TCP port to use (by default is 1935).

       app It is the name of the application to access. It usually corresponds
           to the path where the application is installed on the RTMP server
           (e.g. /ondemand/, /flash/live/, etc.). You can override the value
           parsed from the URI through the "rtmp_app" option, too.

       playpath
           It is the path or name of the resource to play with reference to
           the application specified in app, may be prefixed by "mp4:". You
           can override the value parsed from the URI through the
           "rtmp_playpath" option, too.

       listen
           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       timeout
           Maximum time to wait for the incoming connection. Implies listen.

       Additionally, the following parameters can be set via command line
       options (or in code via "AVOption"s):

       rtmp_app
           Name of application to connect on the RTMP server. This option
           overrides the parameter specified in the URI.

       rtmp_buffer
           Set the client buffer time in milliseconds. The default is 3000.

       rtmp_conn
           Extra arbitrary AMF connection parameters, parsed from a string,
           e.g. like "B:1 S:authMe O:1 NN:code:1.23 NS:flag:ok O:0".  Each
           value is prefixed by a single character denoting the type, B for
           Boolean, N for number, S for string, O for object, or Z for null,
           followed by a colon. For Booleans the data must be either 0 or 1
           for FALSE or TRUE, respectively.  Likewise for Objects the data
           must be 0 or 1 to end or begin an object, respectively. Data items
           in subobjects may be named, by prefixing the type with 'N' and
           specifying the name before the value (i.e. "NB:myFlag:1"). This
           option may be used multiple times to construct arbitrary AMF
           sequences.

       rtmp_flashver
           Version of the Flash plugin used to run the SWF player. The default
           is LNX 9,0,124,2.

       rtmp_flush_interval
           Number of packets flushed in the same request (RTMPT only). The
           default is 10.

       rtmp_live
           Specify that the media is a live stream. No resuming or seeking in
           live streams is possible. The default value is "any", which means
           the subscriber first tries to play the live stream specified in the
           playpath. If a live stream of that name is not found, it plays the
           recorded stream. The other possible values are "live" and
           "recorded".

       rtmp_pageurl
           URL of the web page in which the media was embedded. By default no
           value will be sent.

       rtmp_playpath
           Stream identifier to play or to publish. This option overrides the
           parameter specified in the URI.

       rtmp_subscribe
           Name of live stream to subscribe to. By default no value will be
           sent.  It is only sent if the option is specified or if rtmp_live
           is set to live.

       rtmp_swfhash
           SHA256 hash of the decompressed SWF file (32 bytes).

       rtmp_swfsize
           Size of the decompressed SWF file, required for SWFVerification.

       rtmp_swfurl
           URL of the SWF player for the media. By default no value will be
           sent.

       rtmp_swfverify
           URL to player swf file, compute hash/size automatically.

       rtmp_tcurl
           URL of the target stream. Defaults to proto://host[:port]/app.

       For example to read with ffplay a multimedia resource named "sample"
       from the application "vod" from an RTMP server "myserver":

               ffplay rtmp://myserver/vod/sample

   rtmpe
       Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol.

       The Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMPE) is used for
       streaming multimedia content within standard cryptographic primitives,
       consisting of Diffie-Hellman key exchange and HMACSHA256, generating a
       pair of RC4 keys.

   rtmps
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol over a secure SSL connection.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol (RTMPS) is used for streaming
       multimedia content across an encrypted connection.

   rtmpt
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP (RTMPT) is used
       for streaming multimedia content within HTTP requests to traverse
       firewalls.

   rtmpte
       Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP.

       The Encrypted Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTP
       (RTMPTE) is used for streaming multimedia content within HTTP requests
       to traverse firewalls.

   rtmpts
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTPS.

       The Real-Time Messaging Protocol tunneled through HTTPS (RTMPTS) is
       used for streaming multimedia content within HTTPS requests to traverse
       firewalls.

   rtmp, rtmpe, rtmps, rtmpt, rtmpte
       Real-Time Messaging Protocol and its variants supported through
       librtmp.

       Requires the presence of the librtmp headers and library during
       configuration. You need to explicitly configure the build with
       "--enable-librtmp". If enabled this will replace the native RTMP
       protocol.

       This protocol provides most client functions and a few server functions
       needed to support RTMP, RTMP tunneled in HTTP (RTMPT), encrypted RTMP
       (RTMPE), RTMP over SSL/TLS (RTMPS) and tunneled variants of these
       encrypted types (RTMPTE, RTMPTS).

       The required syntax is:

               <rtmp_proto>://<server>[:<port>][/<app>][/<playpath>] <options>

       where rtmp_proto is one of the strings "rtmp", "rtmpt", "rtmpe",
       "rtmps", "rtmpte", "rtmpts" corresponding to each RTMP variant, and
       server, port, app and playpath have the same meaning as specified for
       the RTMP native protocol.  options contains a list of space-separated
       options of the form key=val.

       See the librtmp manual page (man 3 librtmp) for more information.

       For example, to stream a file in real-time to an RTMP server using
       ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -re -i myfile -f flv rtmp://myserver/live/mystream

       To play the same stream using ffplay:

               ffplay "rtmp://myserver/live/mystream live=1"

   rtp
       Real-Time Protocol.

   rtsp
       RTSP is not technically a protocol handler in libavformat, it is a
       demuxer and muxer. The demuxer supports both normal RTSP (with data
       transferred over RTP; this is used by e.g. Apple and Microsoft) and
       Real-RTSP (with data transferred over RDT).

       The muxer can be used to send a stream using RTSP ANNOUNCE to a server
       supporting it (currently Darwin Streaming Server and Mischa
       Spiegelmock's
        RTSP server ("http://github.com/revmischa/rtsp-server")).

       The required syntax for a RTSP url is:

               rtsp://<hostname>[:<port>]/<path>

       The following options (set on the ffmpeg/ffplay command line, or set in
       code via "AVOption"s or in "avformat_open_input"), are supported:

       Flags for "rtsp_transport":

       udp Use UDP as lower transport protocol.

       tcp Use TCP (interleaving within the RTSP control channel) as lower
           transport protocol.

       udp_multicast
           Use UDP multicast as lower transport protocol.

       http
           Use HTTP tunneling as lower transport protocol, which is useful for
           passing proxies.

       Multiple lower transport protocols may be specified, in that case they
       are tried one at a time (if the setup of one fails, the next one is
       tried).  For the muxer, only the "tcp" and "udp" options are supported.

       Flags for "rtsp_flags":

       filter_src
           Accept packets only from negotiated peer address and port.

       listen
           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       When receiving data over UDP, the demuxer tries to reorder received
       packets (since they may arrive out of order, or packets may get lost
       totally). This can be disabled by setting the maximum demuxing delay to
       zero (via the "max_delay" field of AVFormatContext).

       When watching multi-bitrate Real-RTSP streams with ffplay, the streams
       to display can be chosen with "-vst" n and "-ast" n for video and audio
       respectively, and can be switched on the fly by pressing "v" and "a".

       Example command lines:

       To watch a stream over UDP, with a max reordering delay of 0.5 seconds:

               ffplay -max_delay 500000 -rtsp_transport udp rtsp://server/video.mp4

       To watch a stream tunneled over HTTP:

               ffplay -rtsp_transport http rtsp://server/video.mp4

       To send a stream in realtime to a RTSP server, for others to watch:

               ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f rtsp -muxdelay 0.1 rtsp://server/live.sdp

       To receive a stream in realtime:

               ffmpeg -rtsp_flags listen -i rtsp://ownaddress/live.sdp <output>

   sap
       Session Announcement Protocol (RFC 2974). This is not technically a
       protocol handler in libavformat, it is a muxer and demuxer.  It is used
       for signalling of RTP streams, by announcing the SDP for the streams
       regularly on a separate port.

       Muxer

       The syntax for a SAP url given to the muxer is:

               sap://<destination>[:<port>][?<options>]

       The RTP packets are sent to destination on port port, or to port 5004
       if no port is specified.  options is a "&"-separated list. The
       following options are supported:

       announce_addr=address
           Specify the destination IP address for sending the announcements
           to.  If omitted, the announcements are sent to the commonly used
           SAP announcement multicast address 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net),
           or ff0e::2:7ffe if destination is an IPv6 address.

       announce_port=port
           Specify the port to send the announcements on, defaults to 9875 if
           not specified.

       ttl=ttl
           Specify the time to live value for the announcements and RTP
           packets, defaults to 255.

       same_port=0|1
           If set to 1, send all RTP streams on the same port pair. If zero
           (the default), all streams are sent on unique ports, with each
           stream on a port 2 numbers higher than the previous.  VLC/Live555
           requires this to be set to 1, to be able to receive the stream.
           The RTP stack in libavformat for receiving requires all streams to
           be sent on unique ports.

       Example command lines follow.

       To broadcast a stream on the local subnet, for watching in VLC:

               ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255?same_port=1

       Similarly, for watching in ffplay:

               ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://224.0.0.255

       And for watching in ffplay, over IPv6:

               ffmpeg -re -i <input> -f sap sap://[ff0e::1:2:3:4]

       Demuxer

       The syntax for a SAP url given to the demuxer is:

               sap://[<address>][:<port>]

       address is the multicast address to listen for announcements on, if
       omitted, the default 224.2.127.254 (sap.mcast.net) is used. port is the
       port that is listened on, 9875 if omitted.

       The demuxers listens for announcements on the given address and port.
       Once an announcement is received, it tries to receive that particular
       stream.

       Example command lines follow.

       To play back the first stream announced on the normal SAP multicast
       address:

               ffplay sap://

       To play back the first stream announced on one the default IPv6 SAP
       multicast address:

               ffplay sap://[ff0e::2:7ffe]

   tcp
       Trasmission Control Protocol.

       The required syntax for a TCP url is:

               tcp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]

       listen
           Listen for an incoming connection

       timeout=microseconds
           In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval,
           raise error.  In write mode: if socket cannot be written in more
           than this time interval, raise error.  This also sets timeout on
           TCP connection establishing.

                   ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tcp://<hostname>:<port>?listen
                   ffplay tcp://<hostname>:<port>

   tls
       Transport Layer Security/Secure Sockets Layer

       The required syntax for a TLS/SSL url is:

               tls://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]

       listen
           Act as a server, listening for an incoming connection.

       cafile=filename
           Certificate authority file. The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.

       cert=filename
           Certificate file. The file must be in OpenSSL PEM format.

       key=filename
           Private key file.

       verify=0|1
           Verify the peer's certificate.

       Example command lines:

       To create a TLS/SSL server that serves an input stream.

               ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> tls://<hostname>:<port>?listen&cert=<server.crt>&key=<server.key>

       To play back a stream from the TLS/SSL server using ffplay:

               ffplay tls://<hostname>:<port>

   udp
       User Datagram Protocol.

       The required syntax for a UDP url is:

               udp://<hostname>:<port>[?<options>]

       options contains a list of &-separated options of the form key=val.

       In case threading is enabled on the system, a circular buffer is used
       to store the incoming data, which allows to reduce loss of data due to
       UDP socket buffer overruns. The fifo_size and overrun_nonfatal options
       are related to this buffer.

       The list of supported options follows.

       buffer_size=size
           Set the UDP socket buffer size in bytes. This is used both for the
           receiving and the sending buffer size.

       localport=port
           Override the local UDP port to bind with.

       localaddr=addr
           Choose the local IP address. This is useful e.g. if sending
           multicast and the host has multiple interfaces, where the user can
           choose which interface to send on by specifying the IP address of
           that interface.

       pkt_size=size
           Set the size in bytes of UDP packets.

       reuse=1|0
           Explicitly allow or disallow reusing UDP sockets.

       ttl=ttl
           Set the time to live value (for multicast only).

       connect=1|0
           Initialize the UDP socket with "connect()". In this case, the
           destination address can't be changed with ff_udp_set_remote_url
           later.  If the destination address isn't known at the start, this
           option can be specified in ff_udp_set_remote_url, too.  This allows
           finding out the source address for the packets with getsockname,
           and makes writes return with AVERROR(ECONNREFUSED) if "destination
           unreachable" is received.  For receiving, this gives the benefit of
           only receiving packets from the specified peer address/port.

       sources=address[,address]
           Only receive packets sent to the multicast group from one of the
           specified sender IP addresses.

       block=address[,address]
           Ignore packets sent to the multicast group from the specified
           sender IP addresses.

       fifo_size=units
           Set the UDP receiving circular buffer size, expressed as a number
           of packets with size of 188 bytes. If not specified defaults to
           7*4096.

       overrun_nonfatal=1|0
           Survive in case of UDP receiving circular buffer overrun. Default
           value is 0.

       timeout=microseconds
           In read mode: if no data arrived in more than this time interval,
           raise error.

       Some usage examples of the UDP protocol with ffmpeg follow.

       To stream over UDP to a remote endpoint:

               ffmpeg -i <input> -f <format> udp://<hostname>:<port>

       To stream in mpegts format over UDP using 188 sized UDP packets, using
       a large input buffer:

               ffmpeg -i <input> -f mpegts udp://<hostname>:<port>?pkt_size=188&buffer_size=65535

       To receive over UDP from a remote endpoint:

               ffmpeg -i udp://[<multicast-address>]:<port>

* BITSTREAM FILTERS
       When you configure your FFmpeg build, all the supported bitstream
       filters are enabled by default. You can list all available ones using
       the configure option "--list-bsfs".

       You can disable all the bitstream filters using the configure option
       "--disable-bsfs", and selectively enable any bitstream filter using the
       option "--enable-bsf=BSF", or you can disable a particular bitstream
       filter using the option "--disable-bsf=BSF".

       The option "-bsfs" of the ff* tools will display the list of all the
       supported bitstream filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available bitstream filters.

   aac_adtstoasc
   chomp
   dump_extradata
   h264_mp4toannexb
       Convert an H.264 bitstream from length prefixed mode to start code
       prefixed mode (as defined in the Annex B of the ITU-T H.264
       specification).

       This is required by some streaming formats, typically the MPEG-2
       transport stream format ("mpegts").

       For example to remux an MP4 file containing an H.264 stream to mpegts
       format with ffmpeg, you can use the command:

               ffmpeg -i INPUT.mp4 -codec copy -bsf:v h264_mp4toannexb OUTPUT.ts

   imx_dump_header
   mjpeg2jpeg
       Convert MJPEG/AVI1 packets to full JPEG/JFIF packets.

       MJPEG is a video codec wherein each video frame is essentially a JPEG
       image. The individual frames can be extracted without loss, e.g. by

               ffmpeg -i ../some_mjpeg.avi -c:v copy frames_%d.jpg

       Unfortunately, these chunks are incomplete JPEG images, because they
       lack the DHT segment required for decoding. Quoting from
       <http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/fdd/fdd000063.shtml>:

       Avery Lee, writing in the rec.video.desktop newsgroup in 2001,
       commented that "MJPEG, or at least the MJPEG in AVIs having the MJPG
       fourcc, is restricted JPEG with a fixed -- and *omitted* -- Huffman
       table. The JPEG must be YCbCr colorspace, it must be 4:2:2, and it must
       use basic Huffman encoding, not arithmetic or progressive. . . . You
       can indeed extract the MJPEG frames and decode them with a regular JPEG
       decoder, but you have to prepend the DHT segment to them, or else the
       decoder won't have any idea how to decompress the data. The exact table
       necessary is given in the OpenDML spec."

       This bitstream filter patches the header of frames extracted from an
       MJPEG stream (carrying the AVI1 header ID and lacking a DHT segment) to
       produce fully qualified JPEG images.

               ffmpeg -i mjpeg-movie.avi -c:v copy -bsf:v mjpeg2jpeg frame_%d.jpg
               exiftran -i -9 frame*.jpg
               ffmpeg -i frame_%d.jpg -c:v copy rotated.avi

   mjpega_dump_header
   movsub
   mp3_header_compress
   mp3_header_decompress
   noise
   remove_extradata
* FILTERING INTRODUCTION
       Filtering in FFmpeg is enabled through the libavfilter library.

       Libavfilter is the filtering API of FFmpeg. It is the substitute of the
       now deprecated 'vhooks' and started as a Google Summer of Code project.

       Audio filtering integration into the main FFmpeg repository is a work
       in progress, so audio API and ABI should not be considered stable yet.

       In libavfilter, it is possible for filters to have multiple inputs and
       multiple outputs.  To illustrate the sorts of things that are possible,
       we can use a complex filter graph. For example, the following one:

               input --> split --> fifo -----------------------> overlay --> output
                           |                                        ^
                           |                                        |
                           +------> fifo --> crop --> vflip --------+

       splits the stream in two streams, sends one stream through the crop
       filter and the vflip filter before merging it back with the other
       stream by overlaying it on top. You can use the following command to
       achieve this:

               ffmpeg -i input -vf "[in] split [T1], fifo, [T2] overlay=0:H/2 [out]; [T1] fifo, crop=iw:ih/2:0:ih/2, vflip [T2]" output

       The result will be that in output the top half of the video is mirrored
       onto the bottom half.

       Filters are loaded using the -vf or -af option passed to ffmpeg or to
       ffplay. Filters in the same linear chain are separated by commas. In
       our example, split, fifo, overlay are in one linear chain, and fifo,
       crop, vflip are in another. The points where the linear chains join are
       labeled by names enclosed in square brackets. In our example, that is
       [T1] and [T2]. The special labels [in] and [out] are the points where
       video is input and output.

       Some filters take in input a list of parameters: they are specified
       after the filter name and an equal sign, and are separated from each
       other by a colon.

       There exist so-called source filters that do not have an audio/video
       input, and sink filters that will not have audio/video output.

* GRAPH
       The graph2dot program included in the FFmpeg tools directory can be
       used to parse a filter graph description and issue a corresponding
       textual representation in the dot language.

       Invoke the command:

               graph2dot -h

       to see how to use graph2dot.

       You can then pass the dot description to the dot program (from the
       graphviz suite of programs) and obtain a graphical representation of
       the filter graph.

       For example the sequence of commands:

               echo <GRAPH_DESCRIPTION> | \
               tools/graph2dot -o graph.tmp && \
               dot -Tpng graph.tmp -o graph.png && \
               display graph.png

       can be used to create and display an image representing the graph
       described by the GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string. Note that this string must
       be a complete self-contained graph, with its inputs and outputs
       explicitly defined.  For example if your command line is of the form:

               ffmpeg -i infile -vf scale=640:360 outfile

       your GRAPH_DESCRIPTION string will need to be of the form:

               nullsrc,scale=640:360,nullsink

       you may also need to set the nullsrc parameters and add a format filter
       in order to simulate a specific input file.

* FILTERGRAPH DESCRIPTION
       A filtergraph is a directed graph of connected filters. It can contain
       cycles, and there can be multiple links between a pair of filters. Each
       link has one input pad on one side connecting it to one filter from
       which it takes its input, and one output pad on the other side
       connecting it to the one filter accepting its output.

       Each filter in a filtergraph is an instance of a filter class
       registered in the application, which defines the features and the
       number of input and output pads of the filter.

       A filter with no input pads is called a "source", a filter with no
       output pads is called a "sink".

   Filtergraph syntax
       A filtergraph can be represented using a textual representation, which
       is recognized by the -filter/-vf and -filter_complex options in ffmpeg
       and -vf in ffplay, and by the
       "avfilter_graph_parse()"/"avfilter_graph_parse2()" function defined in
       libavfilter/avfiltergraph.h.

       A filterchain consists of a sequence of connected filters, each one
       connected to the previous one in the sequence. A filterchain is
       represented by a list of ","-separated filter descriptions.

       A filtergraph consists of a sequence of filterchains. A sequence of
       filterchains is represented by a list of ";"-separated filterchain
       descriptions.

       A filter is represented by a string of the form:
       [in_link_1]...[in_link_N]filter_name=arguments[out_link_1]...[out_link_M]

       filter_name is the name of the filter class of which the described
       filter is an instance of, and has to be the name of one of the filter
       classes registered in the program.  The name of the filter class is
       optionally followed by a string "=arguments".

       arguments is a string which contains the parameters used to initialize
       the filter instance, and are described in the filter descriptions
       below.

       The list of arguments can be quoted using the character "'" as initial
       and ending mark, and the character '\' for escaping the characters
       within the quoted text; otherwise the argument string is considered
       terminated when the next special character (belonging to the set
       "[]=;,") is encountered.

       The name and arguments of the filter are optionally preceded and
       followed by a list of link labels.  A link label allows to name a link
       and associate it to a filter output or input pad. The preceding labels
       in_link_1 ... in_link_N, are associated to the filter input pads, the
       following labels out_link_1 ... out_link_M, are associated to the
       output pads.

       When two link labels with the same name are found in the filtergraph, a
       link between the corresponding input and output pad is created.

       If an output pad is not labelled, it is linked by default to the first
       unlabelled input pad of the next filter in the filterchain.  For
       example in the filterchain:

               nullsrc, split[L1], [L2]overlay, nullsink

       the split filter instance has two output pads, and the overlay filter
       instance two input pads. The first output pad of split is labelled
       "L1", the first input pad of overlay is labelled "L2", and the second
       output pad of split is linked to the second input pad of overlay, which
       are both unlabelled.

       In a complete filterchain all the unlabelled filter input and output
       pads must be connected. A filtergraph is considered valid if all the
       filter input and output pads of all the filterchains are connected.

       Libavfilter will automatically insert scale filters where format
       conversion is required. It is possible to specify swscale flags for
       those automatically inserted scalers by prepending "sws_flags=flags;"
       to the filtergraph description.

       Follows a BNF description for the filtergraph syntax:

               <NAME>             ::= sequence of alphanumeric characters and '_'
               <LINKLABEL>        ::= "[" <NAME> "]"
               <LINKLABELS>       ::= <LINKLABEL> [<LINKLABELS>]
               <FILTER_ARGUMENTS> ::= sequence of chars (eventually quoted)
               <FILTER>           ::= [<LINKNAMES>] <NAME> ["=" <ARGUMENTS>] [<LINKNAMES>]
               <FILTERCHAIN>      ::= <FILTER> [,<FILTERCHAIN>]
               <FILTERGRAPH>      ::= [sws_flags=<flags>;] <FILTERCHAIN> [;<FILTERGRAPH>]

   Notes on filtergraph escaping
       Some filter arguments require the use of special characters, typically
       ":" to separate key=value pairs in a named options list. In this case
       the user should perform a first level escaping when specifying the
       filter arguments. For example, consider the following literal string to
       be embedded in the drawtext filter arguments:

               this is a 'string': may contain one, or more, special characters

       Since ":" is special for the filter arguments syntax, it needs to be
       escaped, so you get:

               text=this is a \'string\'\: may contain one, or more, special characters

       A second level of escaping is required when embedding the filter
       arguments in a filtergraph description, in order to escape all the
       filtergraph special characters. Thus the example above becomes:

               drawtext=text=this is a \\\'string\\\'\\: may contain one\, or more\, special characters

       Finally an additional level of escaping may be needed when writing the
       filtergraph description in a shell command, which depends on the
       escaping rules of the adopted shell. For example, assuming that "\" is
       special and needs to be escaped with another "\", the previous string
       will finally result in:

               -vf "drawtext=text=this is a \\\\\\'string\\\\\\'\\\\: may contain one\\, or more\\, special characters"

       Sometimes, it might be more convenient to employ quoting in place of
       escaping. For example the string:

               Caesar: tu quoque, Brute, fili mi

       Can be quoted in the filter arguments as:

               text='Caesar: tu quoque, Brute, fili mi'

       And finally inserted in a filtergraph like:

               drawtext=text=\'Caesar: tu quoque\, Brute\, fili mi\'

       See the quoting_and_escaping, Quoting and escaping section for more
       information about the escaping and quoting rules adopted by FFmpeg.

* AUDIO FILTERS
       When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
       existing filters using "--disable-filters".  The configure output will
       show the audio filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available audio filters.

   aconvert
       Convert the input audio format to the specified formats.

       The filter accepts a string of the form:
       "sample_format:channel_layout".

       sample_format specifies the sample format, and can be a string or the
       corresponding numeric value defined in libavutil/samplefmt.h. Use 'p'
       suffix for a planar sample format.

       channel_layout specifies the channel layout, and can be a string or the
       corresponding number value defined in libavutil/channel_layout.h.

       The special parameter "auto", signifies that the filter will
       automatically select the output format depending on the output filter.

       Some examples follow.

       o   Convert input to float, planar, stereo:

                   aconvert=fltp:stereo

       o   Convert input to unsigned 8-bit, automatically select out channel
           layout:

                   aconvert=u8:auto

   aformat
       Convert the input audio to one of the specified formats. The framework
       will negotiate the most appropriate format to minimize conversions.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       sample_fmts
           A comma-separated list of requested sample formats.

       sample_rates
           A comma-separated list of requested sample rates.

       channel_layouts
           A comma-separated list of requested channel layouts.

       If a parameter is omitted, all values are allowed.

       For example to force the output to either unsigned 8-bit or signed
       16-bit stereo:

               aformat=sample_fmts\=u8\,s16:channel_layouts\=stereo

   amerge
       Merge two or more audio streams into a single multi-channel stream.

       The filter accepts the following named options:

       inputs
           Set the number of inputs. Default is 2.

       If the channel layouts of the inputs are disjoint, and therefore
       compatible, the channel layout of the output will be set accordingly
       and the channels will be reordered as necessary. If the channel layouts
       of the inputs are not disjoint, the output will have all the channels
       of the first input then all the channels of the second input, in that
       order, and the channel layout of the output will be the default value
       corresponding to the total number of channels.

       For example, if the first input is in 2.1 (FL+FR+LF) and the second
       input is FC+BL+BR, then the output will be in 5.1, with the channels in
       the following order: a1, a2, b1, a3, b2, b3 (a1 is the first channel of
       the first input, b1 is the first channel of the second input).

       On the other hand, if both input are in stereo, the output channels
       will be in the default order: a1, a2, b1, b2, and the channel layout
       will be arbitrarily set to 4.0, which may or may not be the expected
       value.

       All inputs must have the same sample rate, and format.

       If inputs do not have the same duration, the output will stop with the
       shortest.

       Example: merge two mono files into a stereo stream:

               amovie=left.wav [l] ; amovie=right.mp3 [r] ; [l] [r] amerge

       Example: multiple merges:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i "
               amovie=input.mkv:si=0 [a0];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=1 [a1];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=2 [a2];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=3 [a3];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=4 [a4];
               amovie=input.mkv:si=5 [a5];
               [a0][a1][a2][a3][a4][a5] amerge=inputs=6" -c:a pcm_s16le output.mkv

   amix
       Mixes multiple audio inputs into a single output.

       For example

               ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex amix=inputs=3:duration=first:dropout_transition=3 OUTPUT

       will mix 3 input audio streams to a single output with the same
       duration as the first input and a dropout transition time of 3 seconds.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       inputs
           Number of inputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       duration
           How to determine the end-of-stream.

           longest
               Duration of longest input. (default)

           shortest
               Duration of shortest input.

           first
               Duration of first input.

       dropout_transition
           Transition time, in seconds, for volume renormalization when an
           input stream ends. The default value is 2 seconds.

   anull
       Pass the audio source unchanged to the output.

   aresample
       Resample the input audio to the specified sample rate.

       The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the output sample rate. If
       not specified then the filter will automatically convert between its
       input and output sample rates.

       For example, to resample the input audio to 44100Hz:

               aresample=44100

   asetnsamples
       Set the number of samples per each output audio frame.

       The last output packet may contain a different number of samples, as
       the filter will flush all the remaining samples when the input audio
       signal its end.

       The filter accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated
       by ":".

       nb_out_samples, n
           Set the number of frames per each output audio frame. The number is
           intended as the number of samples per each channel.  Default value
           is 1024.

       pad, p
           If set to 1, the filter will pad the last audio frame with zeroes,
           so that the last frame will contain the same number of samples as
           the previous ones. Default value is 1.

       For example, to set the number of per-frame samples to 1234 and disable
       padding for the last frame, use:

               asetnsamples=n=1234:p=0

   ashowinfo
       Show a line containing various information for each input audio frame.
       The input audio is not modified.

       The shown line contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form
       key:value.

       A description of each shown parameter follows:

       n   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

       pts Presentation timestamp of the input frame, in time base units; the
           time base depends on the filter input pad, and is usually
           1/sample_rate.

       pts_time
           presentation timestamp of the input frame in seconds

       pos position of the frame in the input stream, -1 if this information
           in unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic
           audio)

       fmt sample format

       chlayout
           channel layout

       rate
           sample rate for the audio frame

       nb_samples
           number of samples (per channel) in the frame

       checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of the audio data. For
           planar audio the data is treated as if all the planes were
           concatenated.

       plane_checksums
           A list of Adler-32 checksums for each data plane.

   asplit
       Split input audio into several identical outputs.

       The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of
       outputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       For example:

               [in] asplit [out0][out1]

       will create two separate outputs from the same input.

       To create 3 or more outputs, you need to specify the number of outputs,
       like in:

               [in] asplit=3 [out0][out1][out2]

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex asplit=5 OUTPUT

       will create 5 copies of the input audio.

   astreamsync
       Forward two audio streams and control the order the buffers are
       forwarded.

       The argument to the filter is an expression deciding which stream
       should be forwarded next: if the result is negative, the first stream
       is forwarded; if the result is positive or zero, the second stream is
       forwarded. It can use the following variables:

       b1 b2
           number of buffers forwarded so far on each stream

       s1 s2
           number of samples forwarded so far on each stream

       t1 t2
           current timestamp of each stream

       The default value is "t1-t2", which means to always forward the stream
       that has a smaller timestamp.

       Example: stress-test "amerge" by randomly sending buffers on the wrong
       input, while avoiding too much of a desynchronization:

               amovie=file.ogg [a] ; amovie=file.mp3 [b] ;
               [a] [b] astreamsync=(2*random(1))-1+tanh(5*(t1-t2)) [a2] [b2] ;
               [a2] [b2] amerge

   atempo
       Adjust audio tempo.

       The filter accepts exactly one parameter, the audio tempo. If not
       specified then the filter will assume nominal 1.0 tempo. Tempo must be
       in the [0.5, 2.0] range.

       For example, to slow down audio to 80% tempo:

               atempo=0.8

       For example, to speed up audio to 125% tempo:

               atempo=1.25

   earwax
       Make audio easier to listen to on headphones.

       This filter adds `cues' to 44.1kHz stereo (i.e. audio CD format) audio
       so that when listened to on headphones the stereo image is moved from
       inside your head (standard for headphones) to outside and in front of
       the listener (standard for speakers).

       Ported from SoX.

   pan
       Mix channels with specific gain levels. The filter accepts the output
       channel layout followed by a set of channels definitions.

       This filter is also designed to remap efficiently the channels of an
       audio stream.

       The filter accepts parameters of the form: "l:outdef:outdef:..."

       l   output channel layout or number of channels

       outdef
           output channel specification, of the form:
           "out_name=[gain*]in_name[+[gain*]in_name...]"

       out_name
           output channel to define, either a channel name (FL, FR, etc.) or a
           channel number (c0, c1, etc.)

       gain
           multiplicative coefficient for the channel, 1 leaving the volume
           unchanged

       in_name
           input channel to use, see out_name for details; it is not possible
           to mix named and numbered input channels

       If the `=' in a channel specification is replaced by `<', then the
       gains for that specification will be renormalized so that the total is
       1, thus avoiding clipping noise.

       Mixing examples

       For example, if you want to down-mix from stereo to mono, but with a
       bigger factor for the left channel:

               pan=1:c0=0.9*c0+0.1*c1

       A customized down-mix to stereo that works automatically for 3-, 4-, 5-
       and 7-channels surround:

               pan=stereo: FL < FL + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BL + 0.6*SL : FR < FR + 0.5*FC + 0.6*BR + 0.6*SR

       Note that ffmpeg integrates a default down-mix (and up-mix) system that
       should be preferred (see "-ac" option) unless you have very specific
       needs.

       Remapping examples

       The channel remapping will be effective if, and only if:

       *<gain coefficients are zeroes or ones,>
       *<only one input per channel output,>

       If all these conditions are satisfied, the filter will notify the user
       ("Pure channel mapping detected"), and use an optimized and lossless
       method to do the remapping.

       For example, if you have a 5.1 source and want a stereo audio stream by
       dropping the extra channels:

               pan="stereo: c0=FL : c1=FR"

       Given the same source, you can also switch front left and front right
       channels and keep the input channel layout:

               pan="5.1: c0=c1 : c1=c0 : c2=c2 : c3=c3 : c4=c4 : c5=c5"

       If the input is a stereo audio stream, you can mute the front left
       channel (and still keep the stereo channel layout) with:

               pan="stereo:c1=c1"

       Still with a stereo audio stream input, you can copy the right channel
       in both front left and right:

               pan="stereo: c0=FR : c1=FR"

   silencedetect
       Detect silence in an audio stream.

       This filter logs a message when it detects that the input audio volume
       is less or equal to a noise tolerance value for a duration greater or
       equal to the minimum detected noise duration.

       The printed times and duration are expressed in seconds.

       duration, d
           Set silence duration until notification (default is 2 seconds).

       noise, n
           Set noise tolerance. Can be specified in dB (in case "dB" is
           appended to the specified value) or amplitude ratio. Default is
           -60dB, or 0.001.

       Detect 5 seconds of silence with -50dB noise tolerance:

               silencedetect=n=-50dB:d=5

       Complete example with ffmpeg to detect silence with 0.0001 noise
       tolerance in silence.mp3:

               ffmpeg -f lavfi -i amovie=silence.mp3,silencedetect=noise=0.0001 -f null -

   volume
       Adjust the input audio volume.

       The filter accepts exactly one parameter vol, which expresses how the
       audio volume will be increased or decreased.

       Output values are clipped to the maximum value.

       If vol is expressed as a decimal number, the output audio volume is
       given by the relation:

               <output_volume> = <vol> * <input_volume>

       If vol is expressed as a decimal number followed by the string "dB",
       the value represents the requested change in decibels of the input
       audio power, and the output audio volume is given by the relation:

               <output_volume> = 10^(<vol>/20) * <input_volume>

       Otherwise vol is considered an expression and its evaluated value is
       used for computing the output audio volume according to the first
       relation.

       Default value for vol is 1.0.

       Examples

       o   Half the input audio volume:

                   volume=0.5

           The above example is equivalent to:

                   volume=1/2

       o   Decrease input audio power by 12 decibels:

                   volume=-12dB

   volumedetect
       Detect the volume of the input video.

       The filter has no parameters. The input is not modified. Statistics
       about the volume will be printed in the log when the input stream end
       is reached.

       In particular it will show the mean volume (root mean square), maximum
       volume (on a per-sample basis), and the beginning of an histogram of
       the registered volume values (from the maximum value to a cumulated
       1/1000 of the samples).

       All volumes are in decibels relative to the maximum PCM value.

       Here is an excerpt of the output:

               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] mean_volume: -27 dB
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] max_volume: -4 dB
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_4db: 6
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_5db: 62
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_6db: 286
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_7db: 1042
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_8db: 2551
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_9db: 4609
               [Parsed_volumedetect_0  0xa23120] histogram_10db: 8409

       It means that:

       o   The mean square energy is approximately -27 dB, or 10^-2.7.

       o   The largest sample is at -4 dB, or more precisely between -4 dB and
           -5 dB.

       o   There are 6 samples at -4 dB, 62 at -5 dB, 286 at -6 dB, etc.

       In other words, raising the volume by +4 dB does not cause any
       clipping, raising it by +5 dB causes clipping for 6 samples, etc.

   asyncts
       Synchronize audio data with timestamps by squeezing/stretching it
       and/or dropping samples/adding silence when needed.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       compensate
           Enable stretching/squeezing the data to make it match the
           timestamps. Disabled by default. When disabled, time gaps are
           covered with silence.

       min_delta
           Minimum difference between timestamps and audio data (in seconds)
           to trigger adding/dropping samples. Default value is 0.1. If you
           get non-perfect sync with this filter, try setting this parameter
           to 0.

       max_comp
           Maximum compensation in samples per second. Relevant only with
           compensate=1.  Default value 500.

       first_pts
           Assume the first pts should be this value.  This allows for
           padding/trimming at the start of stream. By default, no assumption
           is made about the first frame's expected pts, so no padding or
           trimming is done. For example, this could be set to 0 to pad the
           beginning with silence if an audio stream starts after the video
           stream.

   channelsplit
       Split each channel in input audio stream into a separate output stream.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       channel_layout
           Channel layout of the input stream. Default is "stereo".

       For example, assuming a stereo input MP3 file

               ffmpeg -i in.mp3 -filter_complex channelsplit out.mkv

       will create an output Matroska file with two audio streams, one
       containing only the left channel and the other the right channel.

       To split a 5.1 WAV file into per-channel files

               ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter_complex
               'channelsplit=channel_layout=5.1[FL][FR][FC][LFE][SL][SR]'
               -map '[FL]' front_left.wav -map '[FR]' front_right.wav -map '[FC]'
               front_center.wav -map '[LFE]' lfe.wav -map '[SL]' side_left.wav -map '[SR]'
               side_right.wav

   channelmap
       Remap input channels to new locations.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       channel_layout
           Channel layout of the output stream.

       map Map channels from input to output. The argument is a comma-
           separated list of mappings, each in the "in_channel-out_channel" or
           in_channel form. in_channel can be either the name of the input
           channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the input channel
           layout.  out_channel is the name of the output channel or its index
           in the output channel layout. If out_channel is not given then it
           is implicitly an index, starting with zero and increasing by one
           for each mapping.

       If no mapping is present, the filter will implicitly map input channels
       to output channels preserving index.

       For example, assuming a 5.1+downmix input MOV file

               ffmpeg -i in.mov -filter 'channelmap=map=DL-FL\,DR-FR' out.wav

       will create an output WAV file tagged as stereo from the downmix
       channels of the input.

       To fix a 5.1 WAV improperly encoded in AAC's native channel order

               ffmpeg -i in.wav -filter 'channelmap=1\,2\,0\,5\,3\,4:channel_layout=5.1' out.wav

   join
       Join multiple input streams into one multi-channel stream.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       inputs
           Number of input streams. Defaults to 2.

       channel_layout
           Desired output channel layout. Defaults to stereo.

       map Map channels from inputs to output. The argument is a comma-
           separated list of mappings, each in the
           "input_idx.in_channel-out_channel" form. input_idx is the 0-based
           index of the input stream. in_channel can be either the name of the
           input channel (e.g. FL for front left) or its index in the
           specified input stream. out_channel is the name of the output
           channel.

       The filter will attempt to guess the mappings when those are not
       specified explicitly. It does so by first trying to find an unused
       matching input channel and if that fails it picks the first unused
       input channel.

       E.g. to join 3 inputs (with properly set channel layouts)

               ffmpeg -i INPUT1 -i INPUT2 -i INPUT3 -filter_complex join=inputs=3 OUTPUT

       To build a 5.1 output from 6 single-channel streams:

               ffmpeg -i fl -i fr -i fc -i sl -i sr -i lfe -filter_complex
               'join=inputs=6:channel_layout=5.1:map=0.0-FL\,1.0-FR\,2.0-FC\,3.0-SL\,4.0-SR\,5.0-LFE'
               out

   resample
       Convert the audio sample format, sample rate and channel layout. This
       filter is not meant to be used directly.

* AUDIO SOURCES
       Below is a description of the currently available audio sources.

   abuffer
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/asrc_abuffer.h.

       It accepts the following mandatory parameters:
       sample_rate:sample_fmt:channel_layout

       sample_rate
           The sample rate of the incoming audio buffers.

       sample_fmt
           The sample format of the incoming audio buffers.  Either a sample
           format name or its corresponging integer representation from the
           enum AVSampleFormat in libavutil/samplefmt.h

       channel_layout
           The channel layout of the incoming audio buffers.  Either a channel
           layout name from channel_layout_map in libavutil/channel_layout.c
           or its corresponding integer representation from the AV_CH_LAYOUT_*
           macros in libavutil/channel_layout.h

       For example:

               abuffer=44100:s16p:stereo

       will instruct the source to accept planar 16bit signed stereo at
       44100Hz.  Since the sample format with name "s16p" corresponds to the
       number 6 and the "stereo" channel layout corresponds to the value 0x3,
       this is equivalent to:

               abuffer=44100:6:0x3

   aevalsrc
       Generate an audio signal specified by an expression.

       This source accepts in input one or more expressions (one for each
       channel), which are evaluated and used to generate a corresponding
       audio signal.

       It accepts the syntax: exprs[::options].  exprs is a list of
       expressions separated by ":", one for each separate channel. In case
       the channel_layout is not specified, the selected channel layout
       depends on the number of provided expressions.

       options is an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       channel_layout, c
           Set the channel layout. The number of channels in the specified
           layout must be equal to the number of specified expressions.

       duration, d
           Set the minimum duration of the sourced audio. See the function
           "av_parse_time()" for the accepted format.  Note that the resulting
           duration may be greater than the specified duration, as the
           generated audio is always cut at the end of a complete frame.

           If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the audio
           is supposed to be generated forever.

       nb_samples, n
           Set the number of samples per channel per each output frame,
           default to 1024.

       sample_rate, s
           Specify the sample rate, default to 44100.

       Each expression in exprs can contain the following constants:

       n   number of the evaluated sample, starting from 0

       t   time of the evaluated sample expressed in seconds, starting from 0

       s   sample rate

       Examples

       o   Generate silence:

                   aevalsrc=0

       o   Generate a sin signal with frequency of 440 Hz, set sample rate to
           8000 Hz:

                   aevalsrc="sin(440*2*PI*t)::s=8000"

       o   Generate a two channels signal, specify the channel layout (Front
           Center + Back Center) explicitly:

                   aevalsrc="sin(420*2*PI*t):cos(430*2*PI*t)::c=FC|BC"

       o   Generate white noise:

                   aevalsrc="-2+random(0)"

       o   Generate an amplitude modulated signal:

                   aevalsrc="sin(10*2*PI*t)*sin(880*2*PI*t)"

       o   Generate 2.5 Hz binaural beats on a 360 Hz carrier:

                   aevalsrc="0.1*sin(2*PI*(360-2.5/2)*t) : 0.1*sin(2*PI*(360+2.5/2)*t)"

   anullsrc
       Null audio source, return unprocessed audio frames. It is mainly useful
       as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as
       the source for filters which ignore the input data (for example the sox
       synth filter).

       It accepts an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       sample_rate, s
           Specify the sample rate, and defaults to 44100.

       channel_layout, cl
           Specify the channel layout, and can be either an integer or a
           string representing a channel layout. The default value of
           channel_layout is "stereo".

           Check the channel_layout_map definition in
           libavutil/channel_layout.c for the mapping between strings and
           channel layout values.

       nb_samples, n
           Set the number of samples per requested frames.

       Follow some examples:

               #  set the sample rate to 48000 Hz and the channel layout to AV_CH_LAYOUT_MONO.
               anullsrc=r=48000:cl=4

               # same as
               anullsrc=r=48000:cl=mono

   abuffer
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is not intended to be part of user-supplied graph
       descriptions but for insertion by calling programs through the
       interface defined in libavfilter/buffersrc.h.

       It accepts the following named parameters:

       time_base
           Timebase which will be used for timestamps of submitted frames. It
           must be either a floating-point number or in numerator/denominator
           form.

       sample_rate
           Audio sample rate.

       sample_fmt
           Name of the sample format, as returned by
           "av_get_sample_fmt_name()".

       channel_layout
           Channel layout of the audio data, in the form that can be accepted
           by "av_get_channel_layout()".

       All the parameters need to be explicitly defined.

   flite
       Synthesize a voice utterance using the libflite library.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
       "--enable-libflite".

       Note that the flite library is not thread-safe.

       The source accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated
       by ":".

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       list_voices
           If set to 1, list the names of the available voices and exit
           immediately. Default value is 0.

       nb_samples, n
           Set the maximum number of samples per frame. Default value is 512.

       textfile
           Set the filename containing the text to speak.

       text
           Set the text to speak.

       voice, v
           Set the voice to use for the speech synthesis. Default value is
           "kal". See also the list_voices option.

       Examples

       o   Read from file speech.txt, and synthetize the text using the
           standard flite voice:

                   flite=textfile=speech.txt

       o   Read the specified text selecting the "slt" voice:

                   flite=text='So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am':voice=slt

       o   Input text to ffmpeg:

                   ffmpeg -f lavfi -i flite=text='So fare thee well, poor devil of a Sub-Sub, whose commentator I am':voice=slt

       o   Make ffplay speak the specified text, using "flite" and the "lavfi"
           device:

                   ffplay -f lavfi flite=text='No more be grieved for which that thou hast done.'

       For more information about libflite, check:
       <http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/flite/>

* AUDIO SINKS
       Below is a description of the currently available audio sinks.

   abuffersink
       Buffer audio frames, and make them available to the end of filter
       chain.

       This sink is mainly intended for programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/buffersink.h.

       It requires a pointer to an AVABufferSinkContext structure, which
       defines the incoming buffers' formats, to be passed as the opaque
       parameter to "avfilter_init_filter" for initialization.

   anullsink
       Null audio sink, do absolutely nothing with the input audio. It is
       mainly useful as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging
       tools.

   abuffersink
       This sink is intended for programmatic use. Frames that arrive on this
       sink can be retrieved by the calling program using the interface
       defined in libavfilter/buffersink.h.

       This filter accepts no parameters.

* VIDEO FILTERS
       When you configure your FFmpeg build, you can disable any of the
       existing filters using "--disable-filters".  The configure output will
       show the video filters included in your build.

       Below is a description of the currently available video filters.

   alphaextract
       Extract the alpha component from the input as a grayscale video. This
       is especially useful with the alphamerge filter.

   alphamerge
       Add or replace the alpha component of the primary input with the
       grayscale value of a second input. This is intended for use with
       alphaextract to allow the transmission or storage of frame sequences
       that have alpha in a format that doesn't support an alpha channel.

       For example, to reconstruct full frames from a normal YUV-encoded video
       and a separate video created with alphaextract, you might use:

               movie=in_alpha.mkv [alpha]; [in][alpha] alphamerge [out]

       Since this filter is designed for reconstruction, it operates on frame
       sequences without considering timestamps, and terminates when either
       input reaches end of stream. This will cause problems if your encoding
       pipeline drops frames. If you're trying to apply an image as an overlay
       to a video stream, consider the overlay filter instead.

   ass
       Draw ASS (Advanced Substation Alpha) subtitles on top of input video
       using the libass library.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
       "--enable-libass".

       This filter accepts the following named options, expressed as a
       sequence of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       filename, f
           Set the filename of the ASS file to read. It must be specified.

       original_size
           Specify the size of the original video, the video for which the ASS
           file was composed. Due to a misdesign in ASS aspect ratio
           arithmetic, this is necessary to correctly scale the fonts if the
           aspect ratio has been changed.

       If the first key is not specified, it is assumed that the first value
       specifies the filename.

       For example, to render the file sub.ass on top of the input video, use
       the command:

               ass=sub.ass

       which is equivalent to:

               ass=filename=sub.ass

   bbox
       Compute the bounding box for the non-black pixels in the input frame
       luminance plane.

       This filter computes the bounding box containing all the pixels with a
       luminance value greater than the minimum allowed value.  The parameters
       describing the bounding box are printed on the filter log.

   blackdetect
       Detect video intervals that are (almost) completely black. Can be
       useful to detect chapter transitions, commercials, or invalid
       recordings. Output lines contains the time for the start, end and
       duration of the detected black interval expressed in seconds.

       In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
       least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

       This filter accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by ":". A description of the accepted options follows.

       black_min_duration, d
           Set the minimum detected black duration expressed in seconds. It
           must be a non-negative floating point number.

           Default value is 2.0.

       picture_black_ratio_th, pic_th
           Set the threshold for considering a picture "black".  Express the
           minimum value for the ratio:

                   <nb_black_pixels> / <nb_pixels>

           for which a picture is considered black.  Default value is 0.98.

       pixel_black_th, pix_th
           Set the threshold for considering a pixel "black".

           The threshold expresses the maximum pixel luminance value for which
           a pixel is considered "black". The provided value is scaled
           according to the following equation:

                   <absolute_threshold> = <luminance_minimum_value> + <pixel_black_th> * <luminance_range_size>

           luminance_range_size and luminance_minimum_value depend on the
           input video format, the range is [0-255] for YUV full-range formats
           and [16-235] for YUV non full-range formats.

           Default value is 0.10.

       The following example sets the maximum pixel threshold to the minimum
       value, and detects only black intervals of 2 or more seconds:

               blackdetect=d=2:pix_th=0.00

   blackframe
       Detect frames that are (almost) completely black. Can be useful to
       detect chapter transitions or commercials. Output lines consist of the
       frame number of the detected frame, the percentage of blackness, the
       position in the file if known or -1 and the timestamp in seconds.

       In order to display the output lines, you need to set the loglevel at
       least to the AV_LOG_INFO value.

       The filter accepts the syntax:

               blackframe[=<amount>:[<threshold>]]

       amount is the percentage of the pixels that have to be below the
       threshold, and defaults to 98.

       threshold is the threshold below which a pixel value is considered
       black, and defaults to 32.

   boxblur
       Apply boxblur algorithm to the input video.

       This filter accepts the parameters:
       luma_radius:luma_power:chroma_radius:chroma_power:alpha_radius:alpha_power

       Chroma and alpha parameters are optional, if not specified they default
       to the corresponding values set for luma_radius and luma_power.

       luma_radius, chroma_radius, and alpha_radius represent the radius in
       pixels of the box used for blurring the corresponding input plane. They
       are expressions, and can contain the following constants:

       w, h
           the input width and height in pixels

       cw, ch
           the input chroma image width and height in pixels

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for
           the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       The radius must be a non-negative number, and must not be greater than
       the value of the expression "min(w,h)/2" for the luma and alpha planes,
       and of "min(cw,ch)/2" for the chroma planes.

       luma_power, chroma_power, and alpha_power represent how many times the
       boxblur filter is applied to the corresponding plane.

       Some examples follow:

       o   Apply a boxblur filter with luma, chroma, and alpha radius set to
           2:

                   boxblur=2:1

       o   Set luma radius to 2, alpha and chroma radius to 0

                   boxblur=2:1:0:0:0:0

       o   Set luma and chroma radius to a fraction of the video dimension

                   boxblur=min(h\,w)/10:1:min(cw\,ch)/10:1

   colormatrix
       The colormatrix filter allows conversion between any of the following
       color space: BT.709 (bt709), BT.601 (bt601), SMPTE-240M (smpte240m) and
       FCC (fcc).

       The syntax of the parameters is source:destination:

               colormatrix=bt601:smpte240m

   copy
       Copy the input source unchanged to the output. Mainly useful for
       testing purposes.

   crop
       Crop the input video to out_w:out_h:x:y:keep_aspect

       The keep_aspect parameter is optional, if specified and set to a non-
       zero value will force the output display aspect ratio to be the same of
       the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

       The out_w, out_h, x, y parameters are expressions containing the
       following constants:

       x, y
           the computed values for x and y. They are evaluated for each new
           frame.

       in_w, in_h
           the input width and height

       iw, ih
           same as in_w and in_h

       out_w, out_h
           the output (cropped) width and height

       ow, oh
           same as out_w and out_h

       a   same as iw / ih

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for
           the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       n   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       pos the position in the file of the input frame, NAN if unknown

       t   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is
           unknown

       The out_w and out_h parameters specify the expressions for the width
       and height of the output (cropped) video. They are evaluated just at
       the configuration of the filter.

       The default value of out_w is "in_w", and the default value of out_h is
       "in_h".

       The expression for out_w may depend on the value of out_h, and the
       expression for out_h may depend on out_w, but they cannot depend on x
       and y, as x and y are evaluated after out_w and out_h.

       The x and y parameters specify the expressions for the position of the
       top-left corner of the output (non-cropped) area. They are evaluated
       for each frame. If the evaluated value is not valid, it is approximated
       to the nearest valid value.

       The default value of x is "(in_w-out_w)/2", and the default value for y
       is "(in_h-out_h)/2", which set the cropped area at the center of the
       input image.

       The expression for x may depend on y, and the expression for y may
       depend on x.

       Follow some examples:

               # crop the central input area with size 100x100
               crop=100:100

               # crop the central input area with size 2/3 of the input video
               "crop=2/3*in_w:2/3*in_h"

               # crop the input video central square
               crop=in_h

               # delimit the rectangle with the top-left corner placed at position
               # 100:100 and the right-bottom corner corresponding to the right-bottom
               # corner of the input image.
               crop=in_w-100:in_h-100:100:100

               # crop 10 pixels from the left and right borders, and 20 pixels from
               # the top and bottom borders
               "crop=in_w-2*10:in_h-2*20"

               # keep only the bottom right quarter of the input image
               "crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:in_w/2:in_h/2"

               # crop height for getting Greek harmony
               "crop=in_w:1/PHI*in_w"

               # trembling effect
               "crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:(in_w-out_w)/2+((in_w-out_w)/2)*sin(n/10):(in_h-out_h)/2 +((in_h-out_h)/2)*sin(n/7)"

               # erratic camera effect depending on timestamp
               "crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:(in_w-out_w)/2+((in_w-out_w)/2)*sin(t*10):(in_h-out_h)/2 +((in_h-out_h)/2)*sin(t*13)"

               # set x depending on the value of y
               "crop=in_w/2:in_h/2:y:10+10*sin(n/10)"

   cropdetect
       Auto-detect crop size.

       Calculate necessary cropping parameters and prints the recommended
       parameters through the logging system. The detected dimensions
       correspond to the non-black area of the input video.

       It accepts the syntax:

               cropdetect[=<limit>[:<round>[:<reset>]]]

       limit
           Threshold, which can be optionally specified from nothing (0) to
           everything (255), defaults to 24.

       round
           Value which the width/height should be divisible by, defaults to
           16. The offset is automatically adjusted to center the video. Use 2
           to get only even dimensions (needed for 4:2:2 video). 16 is best
           when encoding to most video codecs.

       reset
           Counter that determines after how many frames cropdetect will reset
           the previously detected largest video area and start over to detect
           the current optimal crop area. Defaults to 0.

           This can be useful when channel logos distort the video area. 0
           indicates never reset and return the largest area encountered
           during playback.

   decimate
       This filter drops frames that do not differ greatly from the previous
       frame in order to reduce framerate.  The main use of this filter is for
       very-low-bitrate encoding (e.g. streaming over dialup modem), but it
       could in theory be used for fixing movies that were inverse-telecined
       incorrectly.

       It accepts the following parameters: max:hi:lo:frac.

       max Set the maximum number of consecutive frames which can be dropped
           (if positive), or the minimum interval between dropped frames (if
           negative). If the value is 0, the frame is dropped unregarding the
           number of previous sequentially dropped frames.

           Default value is 0.

       hi, lo, frac
           Set the dropping threshold values.

           Values for hi and lo are for 8x8 pixel blocks and represent actual
           pixel value differences, so a threshold of 64 corresponds to 1 unit
           of difference for each pixel, or the same spread out differently
           over the block.

           A frame is a candidate for dropping if no 8x8 blocks differ by more
           than a threshold of hi, and if no more than frac blocks (1 meaning
           the whole image) differ by more than a threshold of lo.

           Default value for hi is 64*12, default value for lo is 64*5, and
           default value for frac is 0.33.

   delogo
       Suppress a TV station logo by a simple interpolation of the surrounding
       pixels. Just set a rectangle covering the logo and watch it disappear
       (and sometimes something even uglier appear - your mileage may vary).

       The filter accepts parameters as a string of the form "x:y:w:h:band",
       or as a list of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       x, y
           Specify the top left corner coordinates of the logo. They must be
           specified.

       w, h
           Specify the width and height of the logo to clear. They must be
           specified.

       band, t
           Specify the thickness of the fuzzy edge of the rectangle (added to
           w and h). The default value is 4.

       show
           When set to 1, a green rectangle is drawn on the screen to simplify
           finding the right x, y, w, h parameters, and band is set to 4. The
           default value is 0.

       Some examples follow.

       o   Set a rectangle covering the area with top left corner coordinates
           0,0 and size 100x77, setting a band of size 10:

                   delogo=0:0:100:77:10

       o   As the previous example, but use named options:

                   delogo=x=0:y=0:w=100:h=77:band=10

   deshake
       Attempt to fix small changes in horizontal and/or vertical shift. This
       filter helps remove camera shake from hand-holding a camera, bumping a
       tripod, moving on a vehicle, etc.

       The filter accepts parameters as a string of the form
       "x:y:w:h:rx:ry:edge:blocksize:contrast:search:filename"

       A description of the accepted parameters follows.

       x, y, w, h
           Specify a rectangular area where to limit the search for motion
           vectors.  If desired the search for motion vectors can be limited
           to a rectangular area of the frame defined by its top left corner,
           width and height. These parameters have the same meaning as the
           drawbox filter which can be used to visualise the position of the
           bounding box.

           This is useful when simultaneous movement of subjects within the
           frame might be confused for camera motion by the motion vector
           search.

           If any or all of x, y, w and h are set to -1 then the full frame is
           used. This allows later options to be set without specifying the
           bounding box for the motion vector search.

           Default - search the whole frame.

       rx, ry
           Specify the maximum extent of movement in x and y directions in the
           range 0-64 pixels. Default 16.

       edge
           Specify how to generate pixels to fill blanks at the edge of the
           frame. An integer from 0 to 3 as follows:

           0   Fill zeroes at blank locations

           1   Original image at blank locations

           2   Extruded edge value at blank locations

           3   Mirrored edge at blank locations

           The default setting is mirror edge at blank locations.

       blocksize
           Specify the blocksize to use for motion search. Range 4-128 pixels,
           default 8.

       contrast
           Specify the contrast threshold for blocks. Only blocks with more
           than the specified contrast (difference between darkest and
           lightest pixels) will be considered. Range 1-255, default 125.

       search
           Specify the search strategy 0 = exhaustive search, 1 = less
           exhaustive search. Default - exhaustive search.

       filename
           If set then a detailed log of the motion search is written to the
           specified file.

   drawbox
       Draw a colored box on the input image.

       The filter accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated
       by ":".

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       x, y
           Specify the top left corner coordinates of the box. Default to 0.

       width, w
       height, h
           Specify the width and height of the box, if 0 they are interpreted
           as the input width and height. Default to 0.

       color, c
           Specify the color of the box to write, it can be the name of a
           color (case insensitive match) or a 0xRRGGBB[AA] sequence. If the
           special value "invert" is used, the box edge color is the same as
           the video with inverted luma.

       thickness, t
           Set the thickness of the box edge. Default value is 4.

       If the key of the first options is omitted, the arguments are
       interpreted according to the following syntax:

               drawbox=<x>:<y>:<width>:<height>:<color>:<thickness>

       Some examples follow:

       o   Draw a black box around the edge of the input image:

                   drawbox

       o   Draw a box with color red and an opacity of 50%:

                   drawbox=10:20:200:60:red@0.5

           The previous example can be specified as:

                   drawbox=x=10:y=20:w=200:h=60:color=red@0.5

       o   Fill the box with pink color:

                   drawbox=x=10:y=10:w=100:h=100:color=pink@0.5:t=max

   drawtext
       Draw text string or text from specified file on top of video using the
       libfreetype library.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to configure FFmpeg with
       "--enable-libfreetype".

       The filter also recognizes strftime() sequences in the provided text
       and expands them accordingly. Check the documentation of strftime().

       The filter accepts parameters as a list of key=value pairs, separated
       by ":".

       The description of the accepted parameters follows.

       box Used to draw a box around text using background color.  Value
           should be either 1 (enable) or 0 (disable).  The default value of
           box is 0.

       boxcolor
           The color to be used for drawing box around text.  Either a string
           (e.g. "yellow") or in 0xRRGGBB[AA] format (e.g. "0xff00ff"),
           possibly followed by an alpha specifier.  The default value of
           boxcolor is "white".

       draw
           Set an expression which specifies if the text should be drawn. If
           the expression evaluates to 0, the text is not drawn. This is
           useful for specifying that the text should be drawn only when
           specific conditions are met.

           Default value is "1".

           See below for the list of accepted constants and functions.

       fix_bounds
           If true, check and fix text coords to avoid clipping.

       fontcolor
           The color to be used for drawing fonts.  Either a string (e.g.
           "red") or in 0xRRGGBB[AA] format (e.g. "0xff000033"), possibly

           fontsize is 16.

       ft_load_flags
           Flags to be used for loading the fonts.

           The flags map the corresponding flags supported by libfreetype, and
           are a combination of the following values:

           default
           no_scale
           no_hinting
           render
           no_bitmap
           vertical_layout
           force_autohint
           crop_bitmap
           pedantic
           ignore_global_advance_width
           no_recurse
           ignore_transform

           libfreetype flags.

       shadowcolor
           The color to be used for drawing a shadow behind the drawn text.
           It can be a color name (e.g. "yellow") or a string in the
           0xRRGGBB[AA] form (e.g. "0xff00ff"), possibly followed by an alpha
           specifier.  The default value of shadowcolor is "black".

       shadowx, shadowy
           The x and y offsets for the text shadow position with respect to
           the position of the text. They can be either positive or negative
           values. Default value for both is "0".

       tabsize
           The size in number of spaces to use for rendering the tab.  Default
           value is 4.

       timecode
           Set the initial timecode representation in "hh:mm:ss[:;.]ff"
           format. It can be used with or without text parameter.
           timecode_rate option must be specified.

       timecode_rate, rate, r
           Set the timecode frame rate (timecode only).

       text
           The text string to be drawn. The text must be a sequence of UTF-8

           specified with the parameter textfile.

       textfile
           A text file containing text to be drawn. The text must be a
           sequence of UTF-8 encoded characters.

           This parameter is mandatory if no text string is specified with the
           parameter text.

           If both text and textfile are specified, an error is thrown.

       x, y
           The expressions which specify the offsets where text will be drawn
           within the video frame. They are relative to the top/left border of
           the output image.

           The default value of x and y is "0".

           See below for the list of accepted constants and functions.

       The parameters for x and y are expressions containing the following
       constants and functions:

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (w / h) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for
           the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       line_h, lh
           the height of each text line

       main_h, h, H
           the input height

       main_w, w, W
           the input width

       max_glyph_a, ascent
           the maximum distance from the baseline to the highest/upper grid
           coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the
           rendered glyphs.  It is a positive value, due to the grid's
           orientation with the Y axis upwards.

       max_glyph_d, descent
           the maximum distance from the baseline to the lowest grid
           coordinate used to place a glyph outline point, for all the
           rendered glyphs.  This is a negative value, due to the grid's
           orientation, with the Y axis upwards.

       max_glyph_h
           maximum glyph height, that is the maximum height for all the glyphs
           contained in the rendered text, it is equivalent to ascent -
           descent.

       max_glyph_w
           maximum glyph width, that is the maximum width for all the glyphs
           contained in the rendered text

       n   the number of input frame, starting from 0

       rand(min, max)
           return a random number included between min and max

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       t   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is
           unknown

       text_h, th
           the height of the rendered text

       text_w, tw
           the width of the rendered text

       x, y
           the x and y offset coordinates where the text is drawn.

           These parameters allow the x and y expressions to refer each other,
           so you can for example specify "y=x/dar".

       If libavfilter was built with "--enable-fontconfig", then fontfile can
       be a fontconfig pattern or omitted.

       Some examples follow.

       o   Draw "Test Text" with font FreeSerif, using the default values for
           the optional parameters.

                   drawtext="fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text='Test Text'"

       o   Draw 'Test Text' with font FreeSerif of size 24 at position x=100
           and y=50 (counting from the top-left corner of the screen), text is
           yellow with a red box around it. Both the text and the box have an
           opacity of 20%.

                   drawtext="fontfile=/usr/share/fonts/truetype/freefont/FreeSerif.ttf: text='Test Text':\
                             x=100: y=50: fontsize=24: fontcolor=yellow@0.2: box=1: boxcolor=red@0.2"

           Note that the double quotes are not necessary if spaces are not
           used within the parameter list.

       o   Show the text at the center of the video frame:

                   drawtext="fontsize=30:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text='hello world':x=(w-text_w)/2:y=(h-text_h-line_h)/2"

       o   Show a text line sliding from right to left in the last row of the
           video frame. The file LONG_LINE is assumed to contain a single line
           with no newlines.

                   drawtext="fontsize=15:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=LONG_LINE:y=h-line_h:x=-50*t"

       o   Show the content of file CREDITS off the bottom of the frame and
           scroll up.

                   drawtext="fontsize=20:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:textfile=CREDITS:y=h-20*t"

       o   Draw a single green letter "g", at the center of the input video.
           The glyph baseline is placed at half screen height.

                   drawtext="fontsize=60:fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:fontcolor=green:text=g:x=(w-max_glyph_w)/2:y=h/2-ascent"

       o   Show text for 1 second every 3 seconds:

                   drawtext="fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:fontcolor=white:x=100:y=x/dar:draw=lt(mod(t\,3)\,1):text='blink'"

       o   Use fontconfig to set the font. Note that the colons need to be

   edgedetect
       Detect and draw edges. The filter uses the Canny Edge Detection
       algorithm.

       This filter accepts the following optional named parameters:

       low, high
           Set low and high threshold values used by the Canny thresholding
           algorithm.

           The high threshold selects the "strong" edge pixels, which are then
           connected through 8-connectivity with the "weak" edge pixels
           selected by the low threshold.

           low and high threshold values must be choosen in the range [0,1],
           and low should be lesser or equal to high.

           Default value for low is "20/255", and default value for high is
           "50/255".

       Example:

               edgedetect=low=0.1:high=0.4

   fade
       Apply fade-in/out effect to input video.

       It accepts the parameters: type:start_frame:nb_frames[:options]

       type specifies if the effect type, can be either "in" for fade-in, or
       "out" for a fade-out effect.

       start_frame specifies the number of the start frame for starting to
       apply the fade effect.

       nb_frames specifies the number of frames for which the fade effect has
       to last. At the end of the fade-in effect the output video will have
       the same intensity as the input video, at the end of the fade-out
       transition the output video will be completely black.

       options is an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated by ":".
       The description of the accepted options follows.

       type, t
           See type.

       start_frame, s
           See start_frame.

       nb_frames, n
           See nb_frames.

       alpha
           If set to 1, fade only alpha channel, if one exists on the input.
           Default value is 0.

       A few usage examples follow, usable too as test scenarios.

               # fade in first 30 frames of video
               fade=in:0:30

               # fade out last 45 frames of a 200-frame video
               fade=out:155:45

               # fade in first 25 frames and fade out last 25 frames of a 1000-frame video
               fade=in:0:25, fade=out:975:25

               # make first 5 frames black, then fade in from frame 5-24
               fade=in:5:20

               # fade in alpha over first 25 frames of video
               fade=in:0:25:alpha=1

   field
       Extract a single field from an interlaced image using stride arithmetic
       to avoid wasting CPU time. The output frames are marked as non-
       interlaced.

       This filter accepts the following named options:

       type
           Specify whether to extract the top (if the value is 0 or "top") or
           the bottom field (if the value is 1 or "bottom").

       If the option key is not specified, the first value sets the type
       option. For example:

               field=bottom

       is equivalent to:

               field=type=bottom

   fieldorder
       Transform the field order of the input video.

       It accepts one parameter which specifies the required field order that
       the input interlaced video will be transformed to. The parameter can
       assume one of the following values:

       0 or bff
           output bottom field first

       1 or tff
           output top field first

       Default value is "tff".

       Transformation is achieved by shifting the picture content up or down
       by one line, and filling the remaining line with appropriate picture
       content.  This method is consistent with most broadcast field order
       converters.

       If the input video is not flagged as being interlaced, or it is already
       flagged as being of the required output field order then this filter
       does not alter the incoming video.

       This filter is very useful when converting to or from PAL DV material,
       which is bottom field first.

       For example:

               ffmpeg -i in.vob -vf "fieldorder=bff" out.dv

   fifo
       Buffer input images and send them when they are requested.

       This filter is mainly useful when auto-inserted by the libavfilter
       framework.

       The filter does not take parameters.

   format
       Convert the input video to one of the specified pixel formats.
       Libavfilter will try to pick one that is supported for the input to the
       next filter.

       The filter accepts a list of pixel format names, separated by ":", for
       example "yuv420p:monow:rgb24".

       Some examples follow:

               # convert the input video to the format "yuv420p"
               format=yuv420p

               # convert the input video to any of the formats in the list
               format=yuv420p:yuv444p:yuv410p

   fps
       Convert the video to specified constant framerate by duplicating or
       dropping frames as necessary.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       fps Desired output framerate.

       round
           Rounding method. The default is "near".

   framestep
       Select one frame every N.

       This filter accepts in input a string representing a positive integer.
       Default argument is 1.

   frei0r
       Apply a frei0r effect to the input video.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r
       header and configure FFmpeg with "--enable-frei0r".

       The filter supports the syntax:

               <filter_name>[{:|=}<param1>:<param2>:...:<paramN>]

       filter_name is the name of the frei0r effect to load. If the
       environment variable FREI0R_PATH is defined, the frei0r effect is
       searched in each one of the directories specified by the colon (or
       semicolon on Windows platforms) separated list in FREIOR_PATH,
       otherwise in the standard frei0r paths, which are in this order:
       HOME/.frei0r-1/lib/, /usr/local/lib/frei0r-1/, /usr/lib/frei0r-1/.

       param1, param2, ... , paramN specify the parameters for the frei0r
       effect.

       A frei0r effect parameter can be a boolean (whose values are specified
       with "y" and "n"), a double, a color (specified by the syntax R/G/B, R,
       G, and B being float numbers from 0.0 to 1.0) or by an
       "av_parse_color()" color description), a position (specified by the
       syntax X/Y, X and Y being float numbers) and a string.

       The number and kind of parameters depend on the loaded effect. If an
       effect parameter is not specified the default value is set.

       Some examples follow:

       o   Apply the distort0r effect, set the first two double parameters:

                   frei0r=distort0r:0.5:0.01

       o   Apply the colordistance effect, take a color as first parameter:

                   frei0r=colordistance:0.2/0.3/0.4
                   frei0r=colordistance:violet
                   frei0r=colordistance:0x112233

       o   Apply the perspective effect, specify the top left and top right
           image positions:

                   frei0r=perspective:0.2/0.2:0.8/0.2

       For more information see: <http://frei0r.dyne.org>

   geq
       The filter takes one, two or three equations as parameter, separated by
       ':'.  The first equation is mandatory and applies to the luma plane.
       The two following are respectively for chroma blue and chroma red
       planes.

       The filter syntax allows named parameters:

       lum_expr
           the luminance expression

       cb_expr
           the chrominance blue expression

       cr_expr
           the chrominance red expression

       If one of the chrominance expression is not defined, it falls back on
       the other one. If none of them are specified, they will evaluate the
       luminance expression.

       The expressions can use the following variables and functions:

       N   The sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0.

       X, Y
           The coordinates of the current sample.

       W, H
           The width and height of the image.

       SW, SH
           Width and height scale depending on the currently filtered plane.
           It is the ratio between the corresponding luma plane number of
           pixels and the current plane ones. E.g. for YUV4:2:0 the values are
           "1,1" for the luma plane, and "0.5,0.5" for chroma planes.

       p(x, y)
           Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the current
           plane.

       lum(x, y)
           Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the luminance
           plane.

       cb(x, y)
           Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the blue-
           difference chroma plane.

       cr(x, y)
           Return the value of the pixel at location (x,y) of the red-
           difference chroma plane.

       For functions, if x and y are outside the area, the value will be
       automatically clipped to the closer edge.

       Some examples follow:

       o   Flip the image horizontally:

                   geq=p(W-X\,Y)

       o   Generate a fancy enigmatic moving light:

                   nullsrc=s=256x256,geq=random(1)/hypot(X-cos(N*0.07)*W/2-W/2\,Y-sin(N*0.09)*H/2-H/2)^2*1000000*sin(N*0.02):128:128

   gradfun
       Fix the banding artifacts that are sometimes introduced into nearly
       flat regions by truncation to 8bit color depth.  Interpolate the
       gradients that should go where the bands are, and dither them.

       This filter is designed for playback only.  Do not use it prior to
       lossy compression, because compression tends to lose the dither and
       bring back the bands.

       The filter takes two optional parameters, separated by ':':
       strength:radius

       strength is the maximum amount by which the filter will change any one
       pixel. Also the threshold for detecting nearly flat regions. Acceptable
       values range from .51 to 255, default value is 1.2, out-of-range values
       will be clipped to the valid range.

       radius is the neighborhood to fit the gradient to. A larger radius
       makes for smoother gradients, but also prevents the filter from
       modifying the pixels near detailed regions. Acceptable values are 8-32,
       default value is 16, out-of-range values will be clipped to the valid
       range.

               # default parameters
               gradfun=1.2:16

               # omitting radius
               gradfun=1.2

   hflip
       Flip the input video horizontally.

       For example to horizontally flip the input video with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "hflip" out.avi

   hqdn3d
       High precision/quality 3d denoise filter. This filter aims to reduce
       image noise producing smooth images and making still images really
       still. It should enhance compressibility.

       It accepts the following optional parameters:
       luma_spatial:chroma_spatial:luma_tmp:chroma_tmp

       luma_spatial
           a non-negative float number which specifies spatial luma strength,
           defaults to 4.0

       chroma_spatial
           a non-negative float number which specifies spatial chroma
           strength, defaults to 3.0*luma_spatial/4.0

       luma_tmp
           a float number which specifies luma temporal strength, defaults to
           6.0*luma_spatial/4.0

       chroma_tmp
           a float number which specifies chroma temporal strength, defaults
           to luma_tmp*chroma_spatial/luma_spatial

   hue
       Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input.

       This filter accepts the following optional named options:

       h   Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts a float
           number or an expression, and defaults to 0.0.

       H   Specify the hue angle as a number of degrees. It accepts a float
           number or an expression, and defaults to 0.0.

       s   Specify the saturation in the [-10,10] range. It accepts a float
           number and defaults to 1.0.

       The h, H and s parameters are expressions containing the following
       constants:

       n   frame count of the input frame starting from 0

       pts presentation timestamp of the input frame expressed in time base
           units

       r   frame rate of the input video, NAN if the input frame rate is
           unknown

       t   timestamp expressed in seconds, NAN if the input timestamp is
           unknown

       tb  time base of the input video

       The options can also be set using the syntax: hue:saturation

       In this case hue is expressed in degrees.

       Some examples follow:

       o   Set the hue to 90 degrees and the saturation to 1.0:

                   hue=h=90:s=1

       o   Same command but expressing the hue in radians:

                   hue=H=PI/2:s=1

       o   Same command without named options, hue must be expressed in
           degrees:

                   hue=90:1

       o   Note that "h:s" syntax does not support expressions for the values
           of h and s, so the following example will issue an error:

                   hue=PI/2:1

       o   Rotate hue and make the saturation swing between 0 and 2 over a
           period of 1 second:

                   hue="H=2*PI*t: s=sin(2*PI*t)+1"

       o   Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-in effect starting at 0:

                   hue="s=min(t/3\,1)"

           The general fade-in expression can be written as:

                   hue="s=min(0\, max((t-START)/DURATION\, 1))"

       o   Apply a 3 seconds saturation fade-out effect starting at 5 seconds:

                   hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (8-t)/3))"

           The general fade-out expression can be written as:

                   hue="s=max(0\, min(1\, (START+DURATION-t)/DURATION))"

       Commands

       This filter supports the following command:

       reinit
           Modify the hue and/or the saturation of the input video.  The
           command accepts the same named options and syntax than when calling
           the filter from the command-line.

           If a parameter is omitted, it is kept at its current value.

   idet
       Interlaceing detect filter. This filter tries to detect if the input is
       interlaced or progressive. Top or bottom field first.

   lut, lutrgb, lutyuv
       Compute a look-up table for binding each pixel component input value to
       an output value, and apply it to input video.

       lutyuv applies a lookup table to a YUV input video, lutrgb to an RGB
       input video.

       These filters accept in input a ":"-separated list of options, which
       specify the expressions used for computing the lookup table for the
       corresponding pixel component values.

       The lut filter requires either YUV or RGB pixel formats in input, and
       accepts the options:

       c0 (first  pixel component)
       c1 (second pixel component)
       c2 (third  pixel component)
       c3 (fourth pixel component, corresponds to the alpha component)

       The exact component associated to each option depends on the format in
       input.

       The lutrgb filter requires RGB pixel formats in input, and accepts the
       options:

       r (red component)
       g (green component)
       b (blue component)
       a (alpha component)

       The lutyuv filter requires YUV pixel formats in input, and accepts the
       options:

       y (Y/luminance component)
       u (U/Cb component)
       v (V/Cr component)
       a (alpha component)

       The expressions can contain the following constants and functions:

       w, h
           the input width and height

       val input value for the pixel component

       clipval
           the input value clipped in the minval-maxval range

       maxval
           maximum value for the pixel component

       minval
           minimum value for the pixel component

       negval
           the negated value for the pixel component value clipped in the
           minval-maxval range , it corresponds to the expression
           "maxval-clipval+minval"

       clip(val)
           the computed value in val clipped in the minval-maxval range

       gammaval(gamma)
           the computed gamma correction value of the pixel component value
           clipped in the minval-maxval range, corresponds to the expression
           "pow((clipval-minval)/(maxval-minval)\,gamma)*(maxval-minval)+minval"

       All expressions default to "val".

       Some examples follow:

               # negate input video
               lutrgb="r=maxval+minval-val:g=maxval+minval-val:b=maxval+minval-val"
               lutyuv="y=maxval+minval-val:u=maxval+minval-val:v=maxval+minval-val"

               # the above is the same as
               lutrgb="r=negval:g=negval:b=negval"
               lutyuv="y=negval:u=negval:v=negval"

               # negate luminance
               lutyuv=y=negval

               # remove chroma components, turns the video into a graytone image
               lutyuv="u=128:v=128"

               # apply a luma burning effect
               lutyuv="y=2*val"

               # remove green and blue components
               lutrgb="g=0:b=0"

               # set a constant alpha channel value on input
               format=rgba,lutrgb=a="maxval-minval/2"

               # correct luminance gamma by a 0.5 factor
               lutyuv=y=gammaval(0.5)

   mp
       Apply an MPlayer filter to the input video.

       This filter provides a wrapper around most of the filters of
       MPlayer/MEncoder.

       This wrapper is considered experimental. Some of the wrapped filters
       may not work properly and we may drop support for them, as they will be
       implemented natively into FFmpeg. Thus you should avoid depending on
       them when writing portable scripts.

       The filters accepts the parameters: filter_name[:=]filter_params

       filter_name is the name of a supported MPlayer filter, filter_params is
       a string containing the parameters accepted by the named filter.

       The list of the currently supported filters follows:

       denoise3d
       detc
       dint
       divtc
       down3dright
       dsize
       eq2
       eq
       fil
       fspp
       harddup
       il
       ilpack
       ivtc
       kerndeint
       mcdeint
       noise
       ow
       perspective
       phase
       pp7
       pullup
       qp
       sab
       softpulldown
       softskip
       spp
       telecine
       tinterlace
       unsharp
       uspp

       The parameter syntax and behavior for the listed filters are the same
       of the corresponding MPlayer filters. For detailed instructions check
       the "VIDEO FILTERS" section in the MPlayer manual.

       Some examples follow:

       o   Adjust gamma, brightness, contrast:

                   mp=eq2=1.0:2:0.5

       o   Add temporal noise to input video:

                   mp=noise=20t

       See also mplayer(1), <http://www.mplayerhq.hu/>.

   negate
       Negate input video.

       This filter accepts an integer in input, if non-zero it negates the
       alpha component (if available). The default value in input is 0.

   noformat
       Force libavfilter not to use any of the specified pixel formats for the
       input to the next filter.

       The filter accepts a list of pixel format names, separated by ":", for
       example "yuv420p:monow:rgb24".

       Some examples follow:

               # force libavfilter to use a format different from "yuv420p" for the
               # input to the vflip filter
               noformat=yuv420p,vflip

               # convert the input video to any of the formats not contained in the list
               noformat=yuv420p:yuv444p:yuv410p

   null
       Pass the video source unchanged to the output.

   ocv
       Apply video transform using libopencv.

       To enable this filter install libopencv library and headers and
       configure FFmpeg with "--enable-libopencv".

       The filter takes the parameters: filter_name{:=}filter_params.

       filter_name is the name of the libopencv filter to apply.

       filter_params specifies the parameters to pass to the libopencv filter.
       If not specified the default values are assumed.

       Refer to the official libopencv documentation for more precise
       information:
       <http://opencv.willowgarage.com/documentation/c/image_filtering.html>

       Follows the list of supported libopencv filters.

       dilate

       Dilate an image by using a specific structuring element.  This filter
       corresponds to the libopencv function "cvDilate".

       It accepts the parameters: struct_el:nb_iterations.

       struct_el represents a structuring element, and has the syntax:
       colsxrows+anchor_xxanchor_y/shape

       cols and rows represent the number of columns and rows of the
       structuring element, anchor_x and anchor_y the anchor point, and shape
       the shape for the structuring element, and can be one of the values
       "rect", "cross", "ellipse", "custom".

       If the value for shape is "custom", it must be followed by a string of
       the form "=filename". The file with name filename is assumed to
       represent a binary image, with each printable character corresponding
       to a bright pixel. When a custom shape is used, cols and rows are
       ignored, the number or columns and rows of the read file are assumed
       instead.

       The default value for struct_el is "3x3+0x0/rect".

       nb_iterations specifies the number of times the transform is applied to
       the image, and defaults to 1.

       Follow some example:

               # use the default values
               ocv=dilate

               # dilate using a structuring element with a 5x5 cross, iterate two times
               ocv=dilate=5x5+2x2/cross:2

               # read the shape from the file diamond.shape, iterate two times
               # the file diamond.shape may contain a pattern of characters like this:
               #   *
               #  ***
               # *****
               #  ***
               #   *
               # the specified cols and rows are ignored (but not the anchor point coordinates)
               ocv=0x0+2x2/custom=diamond.shape:2

       erode

       Erode an image by using a specific structuring element.  This filter
       corresponds to the libopencv function "cvErode".

       The filter accepts the parameters: struct_el:nb_iterations, with the
       same syntax and semantics as the dilate filter.

       smooth

       Smooth the input video.

       The filter takes the following parameters:
       type:param1:param2:param3:param4.

       type is the type of smooth filter to apply, and can be one of the
       following values: "blur", "blur_no_scale", "median", "gaussian",
       "bilateral". The default value is "gaussian".

       param1, param2, param3, and param4 are parameters whose meanings depend
       on smooth type. param1 and param2 accept integer positive values or 0,
       param3 and param4 accept float values.

       The default value for param1 is 3, the default value for the other
       parameters is 0.

       These parameters correspond to the parameters assigned to the libopencv
       function "cvSmooth".

   overlay
       Overlay one video on top of another.

       It takes two inputs and one output, the first input is the "main" video
       on which the second input is overlayed.

       It accepts the parameters: x:y[:options].

       x is the x coordinate of the overlayed video on the main video, y is
       the y coordinate. x and y are expressions containing the following
       parameters:

       main_w, main_h
           main input width and height

       W, H
           same as main_w and main_h

       overlay_w, overlay_h
           overlay input width and height

       w, h
           same as overlay_w and overlay_h

       options is an optional list of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       rgb If set to 1, force the filter to accept inputs in the RGB color
           space. Default value is 0.

       Be aware that frames are taken from each input video in timestamp
       order, hence, if their initial timestamps differ, it is a a good idea
       to pass the two inputs through a setpts=PTS-STARTPTS filter to have
       them begin in the same zero timestamp, as it does the example for the
       movie filter.

       Follow some examples:

               # draw the overlay at 10 pixels from the bottom right
               # corner of the main video.
               overlay=main_w-overlay_w-10:main_h-overlay_h-10

               # insert a transparent PNG logo in the bottom left corner of the input
               ffmpeg -i input -i logo -filter_complex 'overlay=10:main_h-overlay_h-10' output

               # insert 2 different transparent PNG logos (second logo on bottom
               # right corner):
               ffmpeg -i input -i logo1 -i logo2 -filter_complex
               'overlay=10:H-h-10,overlay=W-w-10:H-h-10' output

               # add a transparent color layer on top of the main video,
               # WxH specifies the size of the main input to the overlay filter
               color=red@.3:WxH [over]; [in][over] overlay [out]

               # play an original video and a filtered version (here with the deshake filter)
               # side by side
               ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[a][b]; [a]pad=iw*2:ih[src]; [b]deshake[filt]; [src][filt]overlay=w'

               # the previous example is the same as:
               ffplay input.avi -vf 'split[b], pad=iw*2[src], [b]deshake, [src]overlay=w'

       You can chain together more overlays but the efficiency of such
       approach is yet to be tested.

   pad
       Add paddings to the input image, and places the original input at the
       given coordinates x, y.

       It accepts the following parameters: width:height:x:y:color.

       The parameters width, height, x, and y are expressions containing the
       following constants:

       in_w, in_h
           the input video width and height

       iw, ih
           same as in_w and in_h

       out_w, out_h
           the output width and height, that is the size of the padded area as
           specified by the width and height expressions

       ow, oh
           same as out_w and out_h

       x, y
           x and y offsets as specified by the x and y expressions, or NAN if
           not yet specified

       a   same as iw / ih

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for
           the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       Follows the description of the accepted parameters.

       width, height
           Specify the size of the output image with the paddings added. If
           the value for width or height is 0, the corresponding input size is
           used for the output.

           The width expression can reference the value set by the height
           expression, and vice versa.

           The default value of width and height is 0.

       x, y
           Specify the offsets where to place the input image in the padded
           area with respect to the top/left border of the output image.

           The x expression can reference the value set by the y expression,
           and vice versa.

           The default value of x and y is 0.

       color
           Specify the color of the padded area, it can be the name of a color
           (case insensitive match) or a 0xRRGGBB[AA] sequence.

           The default value of color is "black".

       Examples

       o   Add paddings with color "violet" to the input video. Output video
           size is 640x480, the top-left corner of the input video is placed
           at column 0, row 40:

                   pad=640:480:0:40:violet

       o   Pad the input to get an output with dimensions increased by 3/2,
           and put the input video at the center of the padded area:

                   pad="3/2*iw:3/2*ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       o   Pad the input to get a squared output with size equal to the
           maximum value between the input width and height, and put the input
           video at the center of the padded area:

                   pad="max(iw\,ih):ow:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       o   Pad the input to get a final w/h ratio of 16:9:

                   pad="ih*16/9:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       o   In case of anamorphic video, in order to set the output display
           aspect correctly, it is necessary to use sar in the expression,
           according to the relation:

                   (ih * X / ih) * sar = output_dar
                   X = output_dar / sar

           Thus the previous example needs to be modified to:

                   pad="ih*16/9/sar:ih:(ow-iw)/2:(oh-ih)/2"

       o   Double output size and put the input video in the bottom-right
           corner of the output padded area:

                   pad="2*iw:2*ih:ow-iw:oh-ih"

   pixdesctest
       Pixel format descriptor test filter, mainly useful for internal
       testing. The output video should be equal to the input video.

       For example:

               format=monow, pixdesctest

       can be used to test the monowhite pixel format descriptor definition.

   removelogo
       Suppress a TV station logo, using an image file to determine which
       pixels comprise the logo. It works by filling in the pixels that
       comprise the logo with neighboring pixels.

       This filter requires one argument which specifies the filter bitmap
       file, which can be any image format supported by libavformat. The width
       and height of the image file must match those of the video stream being
       processed.

       Pixels in the provided bitmap image with a value of zero are not
       considered part of the logo, non-zero pixels are considered part of the
       logo. If you use white (255) for the logo and black (0) for the rest,
       you will be safe. For making the filter bitmap, it is recommended to
       take a screen capture of a black frame with the logo visible, and then
       using a threshold filter followed by the erode filter once or twice.

       If needed, little splotches can be fixed manually. Remember that if
       logo pixels are not covered, the filter quality will be much reduced.
       Marking too many pixels as part of the logo does not hurt as much, but
       it will increase the amount of blurring needed to cover over the image
       and will destroy more information than necessary, and extra pixels will
       slow things down on a large logo.

   scale
       Scale (resize) the input video, using the libswscale library.

       The scale filter forces the output display aspect ratio to be the same
       of the input, by changing the output sample aspect ratio.

       This filter accepts a list of named options in the form of key=value
       pairs separated by ":". If the key for the first two options is not
       specified, the assumed keys for the first two values are "w" and "h".
       If the first option has no key and can be interpreted like a video size
       specification, it will be used to set the video size.

       A description of the accepted options follows.

       width, w
           Set the video width expression, default value is "iw". See below
           for the list of accepted constants.

       height, h
           Set the video heiht expression, default value is "ih".  See below
           for the list of accepted constants.

       interl
           Set the interlacing. It accepts the following values:

           1   force interlaced aware scaling

           0   do not apply interlaced scaling

           -1  select interlaced aware scaling depending on whether the source
               frames are flagged as interlaced or not

           Default value is 0.

       flags
           Set libswscale scaling flags. If not explictly specified the filter
           applies a bilinear scaling algorithm.

       size, s
           Set the video size, the value must be a valid abbreviation or in
           the form widthxheight.

       The values of the w and h options are expressions containing the
       following constants:

       in_w, in_h
           the input width and height

       iw, ih
           same as in_w and in_h

       out_w, out_h
           the output (cropped) width and height

       ow, oh
           same as out_w and out_h

       a   same as iw / ih

       sar input sample aspect ratio

       dar input display aspect ratio, it is the same as (iw / ih) * sar

       hsub, vsub
           horizontal and vertical chroma subsample values. For example for
           the pixel format "yuv422p" hsub is 2 and vsub is 1.

       If the input image format is different from the format requested by the
       next filter, the scale filter will convert the input to the requested
       format.

       If the value for width or height is 0, the respective input size is
       used for the output.

       If the value for width or height is -1, the scale filter will use, for
       the respective output size, a value that maintains the aspect ratio of
       the input image.

       Examples

       o   Scale the input video to a size of 200x100:

                   scale=200:100

           This is equivalent to:

                   scale=w=200:h=100

           or:

                   scale=200x100

       o   Specify a size abbreviation for the output size:

                   scale=qcif

           which can also be written as:

                   scale=size=qcif

       o   Scale the input to 2x:

                   scale=2*iw:2*ih

       o   The above is the same as:

                   scale=2*in_w:2*in_h

       o   Scale the input to 2x with forced interlaced scaling:

                   scale=2*iw:2*ih:interl=1

       o   Scale the input to half size:

                   scale=iw/2:ih/2

       o   Increase the width, and set the height to the same size:

                   scale=3/2*iw:ow

       o   Seek for Greek harmony:

                   scale=iw:1/PHI*iw
                   scale=ih*PHI:ih

       o   Increase the height, and set the width to 3/2 of the height:

                   scale=3/2*oh:3/5*ih

       o   Increase the size, but make the size a multiple of the chroma:

                   scale="trunc(3/2*iw/hsub)*hsub:trunc(3/2*ih/vsub)*vsub"

       o   Increase the width to a maximum of 500 pixels, keep the same input
           aspect ratio:

                   scale='min(500\, iw*3/2):-1'

   select
       Select frames to pass in output.

       It accepts in input an expression, which is evaluated for each input
       frame. If the expression is evaluated to a non-zero value, the frame is
       selected and passed to the output, otherwise it is discarded.

       The expression can contain the following constants:

       n   the sequential number of the filtered frame, starting from 0

       selected_n
           the sequential number of the selected frame, starting from 0

       prev_selected_n
           the sequential number of the last selected frame, NAN if undefined

       TB  timebase of the input timestamps

       pts the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame,
           expressed in TB units, NAN if undefined

       t   the PTS (Presentation TimeStamp) of the filtered video frame,
           expressed in seconds, NAN if undefined

       prev_pts
           the PTS of the previously filtered video frame, NAN if undefined

       prev_selected_pts
           the PTS of the last previously filtered video frame, NAN if
           undefined

       prev_selected_t
           the PTS of the last previously selected video frame, NAN if
           undefined

       start_pts
           the PTS of the first video frame in the video, NAN if undefined

       start_t
           the time of the first video frame in the video, NAN if undefined

       pict_type
           the type of the filtered frame, can assume one of the following
           values:

           I
           P
           B
           S
           SI
           SP
           BI
       interlace_type
           the frame interlace type, can assume one of the following values:

           PROGRESSIVE
               the frame is progressive (not interlaced)

           TOPFIRST
               the frame is top-field-first

           BOTTOMFIRST
               the frame is bottom-field-first

       key 1 if the filtered frame is a key-frame, 0 otherwise

       pos the position in the file of the filtered frame, -1 if the
           information is not available (e.g. for synthetic video)

       scene
           value between 0 and 1 to indicate a new scene; a low value reflects
           a low probability for the current frame to introduce a new scene,
           while a higher value means the current frame is more likely to be
           one (see the example below)

       The default value of the select expression is "1".

       Some examples follow:

               # select all frames in input
               select

               # the above is the same as:
               select=1

               # skip all frames:
               select=0

               # select only I-frames
               select='eq(pict_type\,I)'

               # select one frame every 100
               select='not(mod(n\,100))'

               # select only frames contained in the 10-20 time interval
               select='gte(t\,10)*lte(t\,20)'

               # select only I frames contained in the 10-20 time interval
               select='gte(t\,10)*lte(t\,20)*eq(pict_type\,I)'

               # select frames with a minimum distance of 10 seconds
               select='isnan(prev_selected_t)+gte(t-prev_selected_t\,10)'

       Complete example to create a mosaic of the first scenes:

               ffmpeg -i video.avi -vf select='gt(scene\,0.4)',scale=160:120,tile -frames:v 1 preview.png

       Comparing scene against a value between 0.3 and 0.5 is generally a sane
       choice.

   setdar, setsar
       The "setdar" filter sets the Display Aspect Ratio for the filter output
       video.

       This is done by changing the specified Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio,
       according to the following equation:

               <DAR> = <HORIZONTAL_RESOLUTION> / <VERTICAL_RESOLUTION> * <SAR>

       Keep in mind that the "setdar" filter does not modify the pixel
       dimensions of the video frame. Also the display aspect ratio set by
       this filter may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. in
       case of scaling or if another "setdar" or a "setsar" filter is applied.

       The "setsar" filter sets the Sample (aka Pixel) Aspect Ratio for the
       filter output video.

       Note that as a consequence of the application of this filter, the
       output display aspect ratio will change according to the equation
       above.

       Keep in mind that the sample aspect ratio set by the "setsar" filter
       may be changed by later filters in the filterchain, e.g. if another
       "setsar" or a "setdar" filter is applied.

       The "setdar" and "setsar" filters accept a string in the form num:den
       expressing an aspect ratio, or the following named options, expressed
       as a sequence of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       max Set the maximum integer value to use for expressing numerator and
           denominator when reducing the expressed aspect ratio to a rational.
           Default value is 100.

       r, ratio:
           Set the aspect ratio used by the filter.

           The parameter can be a floating point number string, an expression,
           or a string of the form num:den, where num and den are the
           numerator and denominator of the aspect ratio. If the parameter is
           not specified, it is assumed the value "0".  In case the form
           "num:den" the ":" character should be escaped.

       If the keys are omitted in the named options list, the specifed values
       are assumed to be ratio and max in that order.

       For example to change the display aspect ratio to 16:9, specify:

               setdar='16:9'

       The example above is equivalent to:

               setdar=1.77777

       To change the sample aspect ratio to 10:11, specify:

               setsar='10:11'

       To set a display aspect ratio of 16:9, and specify a maximum integer
       value of 1000 in the aspect ratio reduction, use the command:

               setdar=ratio='16:9':max=1000

   setfield
       Force field for the output video frame.

       The "setfield" filter marks the interlace type field for the output
       frames. It does not change the input frame, but only sets the
       corresponding property, which affects how the frame is treated by
       following filters (e.g. "fieldorder" or "yadif").

       It accepts a string parameter, which can assume the following values:

       auto
           Keep the same field property.

       bff Mark the frame as bottom-field-first.

       tff Mark the frame as top-field-first.

       prog
           Mark the frame as progressive.

   showinfo
       Show a line containing various information for each input video frame.
       The input video is not modified.

       The shown line contains a sequence of key/value pairs of the form
       key:value.

       A description of each shown parameter follows:

       n   sequential number of the input frame, starting from 0

       pts Presentation TimeStamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
           time base units. The time base unit depends on the filter input
           pad.

       pts_time
           Presentation TimeStamp of the input frame, expressed as a number of
           seconds

       pos position of the frame in the input stream, -1 if this information
           in unavailable and/or meaningless (for example in case of synthetic
           video)

       fmt pixel format name

       sar sample aspect ratio of the input frame, expressed in the form
           num/den

       s   size of the input frame, expressed in the form widthxheight

       i   interlaced mode ("P" for "progressive", "T" for top field first,
           "B" for bottom field first)

       iskey
           1 if the frame is a key frame, 0 otherwise

       type
           picture type of the input frame ("I" for an I-frame, "P" for a
           P-frame, "B" for a B-frame, "?" for unknown type).  Check also the
           documentation of the "AVPictureType" enum and of the
           "av_get_picture_type_char" function defined in libavutil/avutil.h.

       checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of all the planes of the
           input frame

       plane_checksum
           Adler-32 checksum (printed in hexadecimal) of each plane of the
           input frame, expressed in the form "[c0 c1 c2 c3]"

   slicify
       Pass the images of input video on to next video filter as multiple
       slices.

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "slicify=32" out.avi

       The filter accepts the slice height as parameter. If the parameter is
       not specified it will use the default value of 16.

       Adding this in the beginning of filter chains should make filtering
       faster due to better use of the memory cache.

   smartblur
       Blur the input video without impacting the outlines.

       The filter accepts the following parameters:
       luma_radius:luma_strength:luma_threshold[:chroma_radius:chroma_strength:chroma_threshold]

       Parameters prefixed by luma indicate that they work on the luminance of
       the pixels whereas parameters prefixed by chroma refer to the
       chrominance of the pixels.

       If the chroma parameters are not set, the luma parameters are used for
       either the luminance and the chrominance of the pixels.

       luma_radius or chroma_radius must be a float number in the range
       [0.1,5.0] that specifies the variance of the gaussian filter used to
       blur the image (slower if larger).

       luma_strength or chroma_strength must be a float number in the range
       [-1.0,1.0] that configures the blurring. A value included in [0.0,1.0]
       will blur the image whereas a value included in [-1.0,0.0] will sharpen
       the image.

       luma_threshold or chroma_threshold must be an integer in the range
       [-30,30] that is used as a coefficient to determine whether a pixel
       should be blurred or not. A value of 0 will filter all the image, a
       value included in [0,30] will filter flat areas and a value included in
       [-30,0] will filter edges.

   split
       Split input video into several identical outputs.

       The filter accepts a single parameter which specifies the number of
       outputs. If unspecified, it defaults to 2.

       For example

               ffmpeg -i INPUT -filter_complex split=5 OUTPUT

       will create 5 copies of the input video.

       For example:

               [in] split [splitout1][splitout2];
               [splitout1] crop=100:100:0:0    [cropout];
               [splitout2] pad=200:200:100:100 [padout];

       will create two separate outputs from the same input, one cropped and
       one padded.

   super2xsai
       Scale the input by 2x and smooth using the Super2xSaI (Scale and
       Interpolate) pixel art scaling algorithm.

       Useful for enlarging pixel art images without reducing sharpness.

   swapuv
       Swap U & V plane.

   thumbnail
       Select the most representative frame in a given sequence of consecutive
       frames.

       It accepts as argument the frames batch size to analyze (default
       N=100); in a set of N frames, the filter will pick one of them, and
       then handle the next batch of N frames until the end.

       Since the filter keeps track of the whole frames sequence, a bigger N
       value will result in a higher memory usage, so a high value is not
       recommended.

       The following example extract one picture each 50 frames:

               thumbnail=50

       Complete example of a thumbnail creation with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf thumbnail,scale=300:200 -frames:v 1 out.png

   tile
       Tile several successive frames together.

       It accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs separated
       by ":". A description of the accepted options follows.

       layout
           Set the grid size (i.e. the number of lines and columns) in the
           form "wxh".

       margin
           Set the outer border margin in pixels.

       padding
           Set the inner border thickness (i.e. the number of pixels between
           frames). For more advanced padding options (such as having
           different values for the edges), refer to the pad video filter.

       nb_frames
           Set the maximum number of frames to render in the given area. It
           must be less than or equal to wxh. The default value is 0, meaning
           all the area will be used.

       Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string:

       layout[:nb_frames[:margin[:padding]]]

       For example, produce 8X8 PNG tiles of all keyframes (-skip_frame nokey)
       in a movie:

               ffmpeg -skip_frame nokey -i file.avi -vf 'scale=128:72,tile=8x8' -an -vsync 0 keyframes%03d.png

       The -vsync 0 is necessary to prevent ffmpeg from duplicating each
       output frame to accomodate the originally detected frame rate.

       Another example to display 5 pictures in an area of "3x2" frames, with
       7 pixels between them, and 2 pixels of initial margin, using mixed flat
       and named options:

               tile=3x2:nb_frames=5:padding=7:margin=2

   tinterlace
       Perform various types of temporal field interlacing.

       Frames are counted starting from 1, so the first input frame is
       considered odd.

       This filter accepts a single parameter specifying the mode. Available
       modes are:

       merge, 0
           Move odd frames into the upper field, even into the lower field,
           generating a double height frame at half framerate.

       drop_odd, 1
           Only output even frames, odd frames are dropped, generating a frame
           with unchanged height at half framerate.

       drop_even, 2
           Only output odd frames, even frames are dropped, generating a frame
           with unchanged height at half framerate.

       pad, 3
           Expand each frame to full height, but pad alternate lines with
           black, generating a frame with double height at the same input
           framerate.

       interleave_top, 4
           Interleave the upper field from odd frames with the lower field
           from even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half
           framerate.

       interleave_bottom, 5
           Interleave the lower field from odd frames with the upper field
           from even frames, generating a frame with unchanged height at half
           framerate.

       interlacex2, 6
           Double frame rate with unchanged height. Frames are inserted each
           containing the second temporal field from the previous input frame
           and the first temporal field from the next input frame. This mode
           relies on the top_field_first flag. Useful for interlaced video
           displays with no field synchronisation.

       Numeric values are deprecated but are accepted for backward
       compatibility reasons.

       Default mode is "merge".

   transpose
       Transpose rows with columns in the input video and optionally flip it.

       This filter accepts the following named parameters:

       dir Specify the transposition direction. Can assume the following
           values:

           0, 4
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise and vertically flip
               (default), that is:

                       L.R     L.l
                       . . ->  . .
                       l.r     R.r

           1, 5
               Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise, that is:

                       L.R     l.L
                       . . ->  . .
                       l.r     r.R

           2, 6
               Rotate by 90 degrees counterclockwise, that is:

                       L.R     R.r
                       . . ->  . .
                       l.r     L.l

           3, 7
               Rotate by 90 degrees clockwise and vertically flip, that is:

                       L.R     r.R
                       . . ->  . .
                       l.r     l.L

           For values between 4-7, the transposition is only done if the input
           video geometry is portrait and not landscape. These values are
           deprecated, the "passthrough" option should be used instead.

       passthrough
           Do not apply the transposition if the input geometry matches the
           one specified by the specified value. It accepts the following
           values:

           none
               Always apply transposition.

           portrait
               Preserve portrait geometry (when height >= width).

           landscape
               Preserve landscape geometry (when width >= height).

           Default value is "none".

   unsharp
       Sharpen or blur the input video.

       It accepts the following parameters:
       luma_msize_x:luma_msize_y:luma_amount:chroma_msize_x:chroma_msize_y:chroma_amount

       Negative values for the amount will blur the input video, while
       positive values will sharpen. All parameters are optional and default
       to the equivalent of the string '5:5:1.0:5:5:0.0'.

       luma_msize_x
           Set the luma matrix horizontal size. It can be an integer between 3
           and 13, default value is 5.

       luma_msize_y
           Set the luma matrix vertical size. It can be an integer between 3
           and 13, default value is 5.

       luma_amount
           Set the luma effect strength. It can be a float number between -2.0
           and 5.0, default value is 1.0.

       chroma_msize_x
           Set the chroma matrix horizontal size. It can be an integer between
           3 and 13, default value is 5.

       chroma_msize_y
           Set the chroma matrix vertical size. It can be an integer between 3
           and 13, default value is 5.

       chroma_amount
           Set the chroma effect strength. It can be a float number between
           -2.0 and 5.0, default value is 0.0.

               # Strong luma sharpen effect parameters
               unsharp=7:7:2.5

               # Strong blur of both luma and chroma parameters
               unsharp=7:7:-2:7:7:-2

               # Use the default values with B<ffmpeg>
               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "unsharp" out.mp4

   vflip
       Flip the input video vertically.

               ffmpeg -i in.avi -vf "vflip" out.avi

   yadif
       Deinterlace the input video ("yadif" means "yet another deinterlacing
       filter").

       It accepts the optional parameters: mode:parity:auto.

       mode specifies the interlacing mode to adopt, accepts one of the
       following values:

       0   output 1 frame for each frame

       1   output 1 frame for each field

       2   like 0 but skips spatial interlacing check

       3   like 1 but skips spatial interlacing check

       Default value is 0.

       parity specifies the picture field parity assumed for the input
       interlaced video, accepts one of the following values:

       0   assume top field first

       1   assume bottom field first

       -1  enable automatic detection

       Default value is -1.  If interlacing is unknown or decoder does not
       export this information, top field first will be assumed.

       auto specifies if deinterlacer should trust the interlaced flag and
       only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced

       0   deinterlace all frames

       1   only deinterlace frames marked as interlaced

       Default value is 0.

* VIDEO SOURCES
       Below is a description of the currently available video sources.

   buffer
       Buffer video frames, and make them available to the filter chain.

       This source is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/vsrc_buffer.h.

       It accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs separated
       by ":". A description of the accepted options follows.

       video_size
           Specify the size (width and height) of the buffered video frames.

       pix_fmt
           A string representing the pixel format of the buffered video
           frames.  It may be a number corresponding to a pixel format, or a
           pixel format name.

       time_base
           Specify the timebase assumed by the timestamps of the buffered
           frames.

       time_base
           Specify the frame rate expected for the video stream.

       pixel_aspect
           Specify the sample aspect ratio assumed by the video frames.

       sws_param
           Specify the optional parameters to be used for the scale filter
           which is automatically inserted when an input change is detected in
           the input size or format.

       For example:

               buffer=size=320x240:pix_fmt=yuv410p:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

       will instruct the source to accept video frames with size 320x240 and
       with format "yuv410p", assuming 1/24 as the timestamps timebase and
       square pixels (1:1 sample aspect ratio).  Since the pixel format with
       name "yuv410p" corresponds to the number 6 (check the enum
       AVPixelFormat definition in libavutil/pixfmt.h), this example
       corresponds to:

               buffer=size=320x240:pixfmt=6:time_base=1/24:pixel_aspect=1/1

       Alternatively, the options can be specified as a flat string, but this
       syntax is deprecated:

       width:height:pix_fmt:time_base.num:time_base.den:pixel_aspect.num:pixel_aspect.den[:sws_param]

   cellauto
       Create a pattern generated by an elementary cellular automaton.

       The initial state of the cellular automaton can be defined through the
       filename, and pattern options. If such options are not specified an
       initial state is created randomly.

       At each new frame a new row in the video is filled with the result of
       the cellular automaton next generation. The behavior when the whole
       frame is filled is defined by the scroll option.

       This source accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by ":". A description of the accepted options follows.

       filename, f
           Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row,
           from the specified file.  In the file, each non-whitespace
           character is considered an alive cell, a newline will terminate the
           row, and further characters in the file will be ignored.

       pattern, p
           Read the initial cellular automaton state, i.e. the starting row,
           from the specified string.

           Each non-whitespace character in the string is considered an alive
           cell, a newline will terminate the row, and further characters in
           the string will be ignored.

       rate, r
           Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per
           second.  Default is 25.

       random_fill_ratio, ratio
           Set the random fill ratio for the initial cellular automaton row.
           It is a floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults
           to 1/PHI.

           This option is ignored when a file or a pattern is specified.

       random_seed, seed
           Set the seed for filling randomly the initial row, must be an
           integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if
           explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed
           on a best effort basis.

       rule
           Set the cellular automaton rule, it is a number ranging from 0 to
           255.  Default value is 110.

       size, s
           Set the size of the output video.

           If filename or pattern is specified, the size is set by default to
           the width of the specified initial state row, and the height is set
           to width * PHI.

           If size is set, it must contain the width of the specified pattern
           string, and the specified pattern will be centered in the larger
           row.

           If a filename or a pattern string is not specified, the size value
           defaults to "320x518" (used for a randomly generated initial
           state).

       scroll
           If set to 1, scroll the output upward when all the rows in the
           output have been already filled. If set to 0, the new generated row
           will be written over the top row just after the bottom row is
           filled.  Defaults to 1.

       start_full, full
           If set to 1, completely fill the output with generated rows before
           outputting the first frame.  This is the default behavior, for
           disabling set the value to 0.

       stitch
           If set to 1, stitch the left and right row edges together.  This is
           the default behavior, for disabling set the value to 0.

       Examples

       o   Read the initial state from pattern, and specify an output of size
           200x400.

                   cellauto=f=pattern:s=200x400

       o   Generate a random initial row with a width of 200 cells, with a
           fill ratio of 2/3:

                   cellauto=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

       o   Create a pattern generated by rule 18 starting by a single alive
           cell centered on an initial row with width 100:

                   cellauto=p=@s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

       o   Specify a more elaborated initial pattern:

                   cellauto=p='@@ @ @@':s=100x400:full=0:rule=18

   mptestsrc
       Generate various test patterns, as generated by the MPlayer test
       filter.

       The size of the generated video is fixed, and is 256x256.  This source
       is useful in particular for testing encoding features.

       This source accepts an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated
       by ":". The description of the accepted options follows.

       rate, r
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of
           frames generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
           frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or
           a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".

       duration, d
           Set the video duration of the sourced video. The accepted syntax
           is:

                   [-]HH:MM:SS[.m...]
                   [-]S+[.m...]

           See also the function "av_parse_time()".

           If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video
           is supposed to be generated forever.

       test, t
           Set the number or the name of the test to perform. Supported tests
           are:

           dc_luma
           dc_chroma
           freq_luma
           freq_chroma
           amp_luma
           amp_chroma
           cbp
           mv
           ring1
           ring2
           all

           Default value is "all", which will cycle through the list of all
           tests.

       For example the following:

               testsrc=t=dc_luma

       will generate a "dc_luma" test pattern.

   frei0r_src
       Provide a frei0r source.

       To enable compilation of this filter you need to install the frei0r
       header and configure FFmpeg with "--enable-frei0r".

       The source supports the syntax:

               <size>:<rate>:<src_name>[{=|:}<param1>:<param2>:...:<paramN>]

       size is the size of the video to generate, may be a string of the form
       widthxheight or a frame size abbreviation.  rate is the rate of the
       video to generate, may be a string of the form num/den or a frame rate
       abbreviation.  src_name is the name to the frei0r source to load. For
       more information regarding frei0r and how to set the parameters read
       the section frei0r in the description of the video filters.

       For example, to generate a frei0r partik0l source with size 200x200 and
       frame rate 10 which is overlayed on the overlay filter main input:

               frei0r_src=200x200:10:partik0l=1234 [overlay]; [in][overlay] overlay

   life
       Generate a life pattern.

       This source is based on a generalization of John Conway's life game.

       The sourced input represents a life grid, each pixel represents a cell
       which can be in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell
       interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are
       horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

       At each interaction the grid evolves according to the adopted rule,
       which specifies the number of neighbor alive cells which will make a
       cell stay alive or born. The rule option allows to specify the rule to
       adopt.

       This source accepts a list of options in the form of key=value pairs
       separated by ":". A description of the accepted options follows.

       filename, f
           Set the file from which to read the initial grid state. In the
           file, each non-whitespace character is considered an alive cell,
           and newline is used to delimit the end of each row.

           If this option is not specified, the initial grid is generated
           randomly.

       rate, r
           Set the video rate, that is the number of frames generated per
           second.  Default is 25.

       random_fill_ratio, ratio
           Set the random fill ratio for the initial random grid. It is a
           floating point number value ranging from 0 to 1, defaults to 1/PHI.
           It is ignored when a file is specified.

       random_seed, seed
           Set the seed for filling the initial random grid, must be an
           integer included between 0 and UINT32_MAX. If not specified, or if
           explicitly set to -1, the filter will try to use a good random seed
           on a best effort basis.

       rule
           Set the life rule.

           A rule can be specified with a code of the kind "SNS/BNB", where NS
           and NB are sequences of numbers in the range 0-8, NS specifies the
           number of alive neighbor cells which make a live cell stay alive,
           and NB the number of alive neighbor cells which make a dead cell to
           become alive (i.e. to "born").  "s" and "b" can be used in place of
           "S" and "B", respectively.

           Alternatively a rule can be specified by an 18-bits integer. The 9
           high order bits are used to encode the next cell state if it is
           alive for each number of neighbor alive cells, the low order bits
           specify the rule for "borning" new cells. Higher order bits encode
           for an higher number of neighbor cells.  For example the number
           6153 = "(12<<9)+9" specifies a stay alive rule of 12 and a born
           rule of 9, which corresponds to "S23/B03".

           Default value is "S23/B3", which is the original Conway's game of
           life rule, and will keep a cell alive if it has 2 or 3 neighbor
           alive cells, and will born a new cell if there are three alive
           cells around a dead cell.

       size, s
           Set the size of the output video.

           If filename is specified, the size is set by default to the same
           size of the input file. If size is set, it must contain the size
           specified in the input file, and the initial grid defined in that
           file is centered in the larger resulting area.

           If a filename is not specified, the size value defaults to
           "320x240" (used for a randomly generated initial grid).

       stitch
           If set to 1, stitch the left and right grid edges together, and the
           top and bottom edges also. Defaults to 1.

       mold
           Set cell mold speed. If set, a dead cell will go from death_color
           to mold_color with a step of mold. mold can have a value from 0 to
           255.

       life_color
           Set the color of living (or new born) cells.

       death_color
           Set the color of dead cells. If mold is set, this is the first
           color used to represent a dead cell.

       mold_color
           Set mold color, for definitely dead and moldy cells.

       Examples

       o   Read a grid from pattern, and center it on a grid of size 300x300
           pixels:

                   life=f=pattern:s=300x300

       o   Generate a random grid of size 200x200, with a fill ratio of 2/3:

                   life=ratio=2/3:s=200x200

       o   Specify a custom rule for evolving a randomly generated grid:

                   life=rule=S14/B34

       o   Full example with slow death effect (mold) using ffplay:

                   ffplay -f lavfi life=s=300x200:mold=10:r=60:ratio=0.1:death_color=#C83232:life_color=#00ff00,scale=1200:800:flags=16

   color, nullsrc, rgbtestsrc, smptebars, testsrc
       The "color" source provides an uniformly colored input.

       The "nullsrc" source returns unprocessed video frames. It is mainly
       useful to be employed in analysis / debugging tools, or as the source
       for filters which ignore the input data.

       The "rgbtestsrc" source generates an RGB test pattern useful for
       detecting RGB vs BGR issues. You should see a red, green and blue
       stripe from top to bottom.

       The "smptebars" source generates a color bars pattern, based on the
       SMPTE Engineering Guideline EG 1-1990.

       The "testsrc" source generates a test video pattern, showing a color
       pattern, a scrolling gradient and a timestamp. This is mainly intended
       for testing purposes.

       These sources accept an optional sequence of key=value pairs, separated
       by ":". The description of the accepted options follows.

       color, c
           Specify the color of the source, only used in the "color" source.
           It can be the name of a color (case insensitive match) or a
           0xRRGGBB[AA] sequence, possibly followed by an alpha specifier. The
           default value is "black".

       size, s
           Specify the size of the sourced video, it may be a string of the
           form widthxheight, or the name of a size abbreviation. The default
           value is "320x240".

       rate, r
           Specify the frame rate of the sourced video, as the number of
           frames generated per second. It has to be a string in the format
           frame_rate_num/frame_rate_den, an integer number, a float number or
           a valid video frame rate abbreviation. The default value is "25".

       sar Set the sample aspect ratio of the sourced video.

       duration, d
           Set the video duration of the sourced video. The accepted syntax
           is:

                   [-]HH[:MM[:SS[.m...]]]
                   [-]S+[.m...]

           See also the function "av_parse_time()".

           If not specified, or the expressed duration is negative, the video
           is supposed to be generated forever.

       decimals, n
           Set the number of decimals to show in the timestamp, only used in
           the "testsrc" source.

           The displayed timestamp value will correspond to the original
           timestamp value multiplied by the power of 10 of the specified
           value. Default value is 0.

       For example the following:

               testsrc=duration=5.3:size=qcif:rate=10

       will generate a video with a duration of 5.3 seconds, with size 176x144
       and a frame rate of 10 frames per second.

       The following graph description will generate a red source with an
       opacity of 0.2, with size "qcif" and a frame rate of 10 frames per
       second.

               color=c=red@0.2:s=qcif:r=10

       If the input content is to be ignored, "nullsrc" can be used. The
       following command generates noise in the luminance plane by employing
       the "geq" filter:

               nullsrc=s=256x256, geq=random(1)*255:128:128

* VIDEO SINKS
       Below is a description of the currently available video sinks.

   buffersink
       Buffer video frames, and make them available to the end of the filter
       graph.

       This sink is mainly intended for a programmatic use, in particular
       through the interface defined in libavfilter/buffersink.h.

       It does not require a string parameter in input, but you need to
       specify a pointer to a list of supported pixel formats terminated by -1
       in the opaque parameter provided to "avfilter_init_filter" when
       initializing this sink.

   nullsink
       Null video sink, do absolutely nothing with the input video. It is
       mainly useful as a template and to be employed in analysis / debugging
       tools.

* MULTIMEDIA FILTERS
       Below is a description of the currently available multimedia filters.

   asendcmd, sendcmd
       Send commands to filters in the filtergraph.

       These filters read commands to be sent to other filters in the
       filtergraph.

       "asendcmd" must be inserted between two audio filters, "sendcmd" must
       be inserted between two video filters, but apart from that they act the
       same way.

       The specification of commands can be provided in the filter arguments
       with the commands option, or in a file specified by the filename
       option.

       These filters accept the following options:

       commands, c
           Set the commands to be read and sent to the other filters.

       filename, f
           Set the filename of the commands to be read and sent to the other
           filters.

       Commands syntax

       A commands description consists of a sequence of interval
       specifications, comprising a list of commands to be executed when a
       particular event related to that interval occurs. The occurring event
       is typically the current frame time entering or leaving a given time
       interval.

       An interval is specified by the following syntax:

               <START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>;

       The time interval is specified by the START and END times.  END is
       optional and defaults to the maximum time.

       The current frame time is considered within the specified interval if
       it is included in the interval [START, END), that is when the time is
       greater or equal to START and is lesser than END.

       COMMANDS consists of a sequence of one or more command specifications,
       separated by ",", relating to that interval.  The syntax of a command
       specification is given by:

               [<FLAGS>] <TARGET> <COMMAND> <ARG>

       FLAGS is optional and specifies the type of events relating to the time
       interval which enable sending the specified command, and must be a non-
       null sequence of identifier flags separated by "+" or "|" and enclosed
       between "[" and "]".

       The following flags are recognized:

       enter
           The command is sent when the current frame timestamp enters the
           specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
           previous frame timestamp was not in the given interval, and the
           current is.

       leave
           The command is sent when the current frame timestamp leaves the
           specified interval. In other words, the command is sent when the
           previous frame timestamp was in the given interval, and the current
           is not.

       If FLAGS is not specified, a default value of "[enter]" is assumed.

       TARGET specifies the target of the command, usually the name of the
       filter class or a specific filter instance name.

       COMMAND specifies the name of the command for the target filter.

       ARG is optional and specifies the optional list of argument for the
       given COMMAND.

       Between one interval specification and another, whitespaces, or
       sequences of characters starting with "#" until the end of line, are
       ignored and can be used to annotate comments.

       A simplified BNF description of the commands specification syntax
       follows:

               <COMMAND_FLAG>  ::= "enter" | "leave"
               <COMMAND_FLAGS> ::= <COMMAND_FLAG> [(+|"|")<COMMAND_FLAG>]
               <COMMAND>       ::= ["[" <COMMAND_FLAGS> "]"] <TARGET> <COMMAND> [<ARG>]
               <COMMANDS>      ::= <COMMAND> [,<COMMANDS>]
               <INTERVAL>      ::= <START>[-<END>] <COMMANDS>
               <INTERVALS>     ::= <INTERVAL>[;<INTERVALS>]

       Examples

       o   Specify audio tempo change at second 4:

                   asendcmd=c='4.0 atempo tempo 1.5',atempo

       o   Specify a list of drawtext and hue commands in a file.

                   # show text in the interval 5-10
                   5.0-10.0 [enter] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=hello world',
                            [leave] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=';

                   # desaturate the image in the interval 15-20
                   15.0-20.0 [enter] hue reinit s=0,
                             [enter] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=nocolor',
                             [leave] hue reinit s=1,
                             [leave] drawtext reinit 'fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text=color';

                   # apply an exponential saturation fade-out effect, starting from time 25
                   25 [enter] hue s=exp(t-25)

           A filtergraph allowing to read and process the above command list
           stored in a file test.cmd, can be specified with:

                   sendcmd=f=test.cmd,drawtext=fontfile=FreeSerif.ttf:text='',hue

   asetpts, setpts
       Change the PTS (presentation timestamp) of the input frames.

       "asetpts" works on audio frames, "setpts" on video frames.

       Accept in input an expression evaluated through the eval API, which can
       contain the following constants:

       FRAME_RATE
           frame rate, only defined for constant frame-rate video

       PTS the presentation timestamp in input

                   setpts=0.5*PTS

       o   Apply slow motion effect:

                   setpts=2.0*PTS

       o   Set fixed rate of 25 frames per second:

                   setpts=N/(25*TB)

       o   Set fixed rate 25 fps with some jitter:

                   setpts='1/(25*TB) * (N + 0.05 * sin(N*2*PI/25))'

       o   Apply an offset of 10 seconds to the input PTS:

                   setpts=PTS+10/TB

   ebur128
       EBU R128 scanner filter. This filter takes an audio stream as input and
       outputs it unchanged. By default, it logs a message at a frequency of
       10Hz with the Momentary loudness (identified by "M"), Short-term
       loudness ("S"), Integrated loudness ("I") and Loudness Range ("LRA").

       The filter also has a video output (see the video option) with a real
       time graph to observe the loudness evolution. The graphic contains the
       logged message mentioned above, so it is not printed anymore when this
       option is set, unless the verbose logging is set. The main graphing
       area contains the short-term loudness (3 seconds of analysis), and the
       gauge on the right is for the momentary loudness (400 milliseconds).

       More information about the Loudness Recommendation EBU R128 on
       <http://tech.ebu.ch/loudness>.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       video
           Activate the video output. The audio stream is passed unchanged
           whether this option is set or no. The video stream will be the
           first output stream if activated. Default is 0.

       size
           Set the video size. This option is for video only. Default and
           minimum resolution is "640x480".

       meter
           Set the EBU scale meter. Default is 9. Common values are 9 and 18,
           respectively for EBU scale meter +9 and EBU scale meter +18. Any
           other integer value between this range is allowed.

       Example of real-time graph using ffplay, with a EBU scale meter +18:

               ffplay -f lavfi -i "amovie=input.mp3,ebur128=video=1:meter=18 [out0][out1]"

       Run an analysis with ffmpeg:

               ffmpeg -nostats -i input.mp3 -filter_complex ebur128 -f null -

   settb, asettb
       Set the timebase to use for the output frames timestamps.  It is mainly
       useful for testing timebase configuration.

       It accepts in input an arithmetic expression representing a rational.
       The expression can contain the constants "AVTB" (the default timebase),
       "intb" (the input timebase) and "sr" (the sample rate, audio only).

       The default value for the input is "intb".

       Examples

       o   Set the timebase to 1/25:

                   settb=1/25

       o   Set the timebase to 1/10:

                   settb=0.1

       o   Set the timebase to 1001/1000:

                   settb=1+0.001

       o   Set the timebase to 2*intb:

                   settb=2*intb

       o   Set the default timebase value:

                   settb=AVTB

   concat
       Concatenate audio and video streams, joining them together one after
       the other.

       The filter works on segments of synchronized video and audio streams.
       All segments must have the same number of streams of each type, and
       that will also be the number of streams at output.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       n   Set the number of segments. Default is 2.

       v   Set the number of output video streams, that is also the number of
           video streams in each segment. Default is 1.

       a   Set the number of output audio streams, that is also the number of
           video streams in each segment. Default is 0.

       unsafe
           Activate unsafe mode: do not fail if segments have a different
           format.

       The filter has v+a outputs: first v video outputs, then a audio
       outputs.

       There are nX(v+a) inputs: first the inputs for the first segment, in
       the same order as the outputs, then the inputs for the second segment,
       etc.

       Related streams do not always have exactly the same duration, for
       various reasons including codec frame size or sloppy authoring. For
       that reason, related synchronized streams (e.g. a video and its audio
       track) should be concatenated at once. The concat filter will use the
       duration of the longest stream in each segment (except the last one),
       and if necessary pad shorter audio streams with silence.

       For this filter to work correctly, all segments must start at timestamp
       0.

       All corresponding streams must have the same parameters in all
       segments; the filtering system will automatically select a common pixel
       format for video streams, and a common sample format, sample rate and
       channel layout for audio streams, but other settings, such as
       resolution, must be converted explicitly by the user.

       Different frame rates are acceptable but will result in variable frame
       rate at output; be sure to configure the output file to handle it.

       Examples:

       o   Concatenate an opening, an episode and an ending, all in bilingual
           version (video in stream 0, audio in streams 1 and 2):

                   ffmpeg -i opening.mkv -i episode.mkv -i ending.mkv -filter_complex \
                     '[0:0] [0:1] [0:2] [1:0] [1:1] [1:2] [2:0] [2:1] [2:2]
                      concat=n=3:v=1:a=2 [v] [a1] [a2]' \
                     -map '[v]' -map '[a1]' -map '[a2]' output.mkv

       o   Concatenate two parts, handling audio and video separately, using
           the (a)movie sources, and adjusting the resolution:

                   movie=part1.mp4, scale=512:288 [v1] ; amovie=part1.mp4 [a1] ;
                   movie=part2.mp4, scale=512:288 [v2] ; amovie=part2.mp4 [a2] ;
                   [v1] [v2] concat [outv] ; [a1] [a2] concat=v=0:a=1 [outa]

           Note that a desync will happen at the stitch if the audio and video
           streams do not have exactly the same duration in the first file.

   showspectrum
       Convert input audio to a video output, representing the audio frequency
       spectrum.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       size, s
           Specify the video size for the output. Default value is "640x480".

       slide
           Specify if the spectrum should slide along the window. Default
           value is 0.

       The usage is very similar to the showwaves filter; see the examples in
       that section.

   showwaves
       Convert input audio to a video output, representing the samples waves.

       The filter accepts the following named parameters:

       n   Set the number of samples which are printed on the same column. A
           larger value will decrease the frame rate. Must be a positive
           integer. This option can be set only if the value for rate is not
           explicitly specified.

       rate, r
           Set the (approximate) output frame rate. This is done by setting
           the option n. Default value is "25".

       size, s
           Specify the video size for the output. Default value is "600x240".

       Some examples follow.

       o   Output the input file audio and the corresponding video
           representation at the same time:

                   amovie=a.mp3,asplit[out0],showwaves[out1]

       o   Create a synthetic signal and show it with showwaves, forcing a
           framerate of 30 frames per second:

                   aevalsrc=sin(1*2*PI*t)*sin(880*2*PI*t):cos(2*PI*200*t),asplit[out0],showwaves=r=30[out1]

* MULTIMEDIA SOURCES
       Below is a description of the currently available multimedia sources.

   amovie
       This is the same as src_movie source, except it selects an audio stream
       by default.

   movie
       Read audio and/or video stream(s) from a movie container.

       It accepts the syntax: movie_name[:options] where movie_name is the
       name of the resource to read (not necessarily a file but also a device
       or a stream accessed through some protocol), and options is an optional
       sequence of key=value pairs, separated by ":".

       The description of the accepted options follows.

       format_name, f
           Specifies the format assumed for the movie to read, and can be
           either the name of a container or an input device. If not specified
           the format is guessed from movie_name or by probing.

       seek_point, sp
           Specifies the seek point in seconds, the frames will be output
           starting from this seek point, the parameter is evaluated with
           "av_strtod" so the numerical value may be suffixed by an IS
           postfix. Default value is "0".

       streams, s
           Specifies the streams to read. Several streams can be specified,
           separated by "+". The source will then have as many outputs, in the
           same order. The syntax is explained in the Stream specifiers
           chapter. Two special names, "dv" and "da" specify respectively the
           default (best suited) video and audio stream. Default is "dv", or
           "da" if the filter is called as "amovie".

       stream_index, si
           Specifies the index of the video stream to read. If the value is
           -1, the best suited video stream will be automatically selected.
           Default value is "-1". Deprecated. If the filter is called
           "amovie", it will select audio instead of video.

       loop
           Specifies how many times to read the stream in sequence.  If the
           value is less than 1, the stream will be read again and again.
           Default value is "1".

           Note that when the movie is looped the source timestamps are not
           changed, so it will generate non monotonically increasing
           timestamps.

       This filter allows to overlay a second video on top of main input of a
       filtergraph as shown in this graph:

               input -----------> deltapts0 --> overlay --> output
                                                   ^
                                                   |
               movie --> scale--> deltapts1 -------+

       Some examples follow.

       o   Skip 3.2 seconds from the start of the avi file in.avi, and overlay
           it on top of the input labelled as "in":

                   movie=in.avi:seek_point=3.2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [movie];
                   [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, [movie] overlay=16:16 [out]

       o   Read from a video4linux2 device, and overlay it on top of the input
           labelled as "in":

                   movie=/dev/video0:f=video4linux2, scale=180:-1, setpts=PTS-STARTPTS [movie];
                   [in] setpts=PTS-STARTPTS, [movie] overlay=16:16 [out]

       o   Read the first video stream and the audio stream with id 0x81 from
           dvd.vob; the video is connected to the pad named "video" and the
           audio is connected to the pad named "audio":

                   movie=dvd.vob:s=v:0+#0x81 [video] [audio]

* METADATA
       FFmpeg is able to dump metadata from media files into a simple
       UTF-8-encoded INI-like text file and then load it back using the
       metadata muxer/demuxer.

       The file format is as follows:

       1.  A file consists of a header and a number of metadata tags divided
           into sections, each on its own line.

       2.  The header is a ';FFMETADATA' string, followed by a version number
           (now 1).

       3.  Metadata tags are of the form 'key=value'

       4.  Immediately after header follows global metadata

       5.  After global metadata there may be sections with
           per-stream/per-chapter metadata.

       6.  A section starts with the section name in uppercase (i.e. STREAM or
           CHAPTER) in brackets ('[', ']') and ends with next section or end
           of file.

       7.  At the beginning of a chapter section there may be an optional
           timebase to be used for start/end values. It must be in form
           'TIMEBASE=num/den', where num and den are integers. If the timebase
           is missing then start/end times are assumed to be in milliseconds.
           Next a chapter section must contain chapter start and end times in
           form 'START=num', 'END=num', where num is a positive integer.

       8.  Empty lines and lines starting with ';' or '#' are ignored.

       9.  Metadata keys or values containing special characters ('=', ';',
           '#', '\' and a newline) must be escaped with a backslash '\'.

       10. Note that whitespace in metadata (e.g. foo = bar) is considered to
           be a part of the tag (in the example above key is 'foo ', value is
           ' bar').

       A ffmetadata file might look like this:

               ;FFMETADATA1
               title=bike\\shed
               ;this is a comment
               artist=FFmpeg troll team

               [CHAPTER]
               TIMEBASE=1/1000
               START=0
               #chapter ends at 0:01:00
               END=60000
               title=chapter \#1

               line
